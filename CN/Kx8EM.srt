2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,860
Can you tell me your country's name in Chinese?

3
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,630
[Yīngguó, Hánguó, Āijí, Àodàlìyà?]

4
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,890
In this lesson, we're going to learn how to count numbers

5
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,915
and talk about people's ages in Chinese.

6
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:49,560
Follow me to read 1 to 10 please.

7
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:59,430
[Yī, yī]

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,430

[shí, shí]

17
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:47,470
On top, the number is

18
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,770
[líng, líng]

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,940
Wow, so many pandas.

20
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,190
[Dàxióngmāo]

21
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,095
Let's read it.

22
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:09,950
[Yī, yī]

23
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,630

[jiǔ, jiǔ]

31
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,600
The last picture,

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,020
[shí, shí]

33
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,199
Numbers above 10 are easy to remember,

34
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:11,640
you just say [ten one, ten two] et cetera.

35
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,590
[Shí yī, shí èr]

36
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,790
Let's see some more numbers.

37
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,620
Read the list with me, please.

38
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,840

[jiù shí jiǔ]

49
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,540
How do you ask someone's age in Chinese?

50
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,030
Here is a video for you.

51
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:22,030
>> [Xùdōng, nǐ duō dà le?]
>> [Wǒ èr shí sì suì. Nǐ ne?]

52
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:31,950
>> [Wǒ èr shí yi suì. Tā duǒ dà le?]
>> [Tā shí bā suì.]

53
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,710
Did you hear the age of these three people?

54
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,320
[èr shí sì]

55
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,850
[èr shí yī]

56
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,760
[shí bā]

57
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,795
[Nǐ duō dà le?]

58
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:59,430
How old are you?

59
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,650
[Duo da] means how old.

60
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:12,110
[Le] is used at the end of a sentence to
indicate change of state.

61
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:20,905
In other words, there's now a new situation
or there is about to be a new situation.

62
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:24,445
[Suì] means year.

63
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:27,085
For the answer to the question,

64
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:29,425
[nǐ duō dà le?]

65
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:36,160
you say, [wǒ], plus your age
and then [suì].

66
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,020
Read after me please.

67
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:49,460
[Nǐ duō dà le?] [Nǐ duō dà le?]

68
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:56,615
[Wǒ èr shí sì suì.]
[Wǒ èr shí sì suì.]

69
00:05:56,615 --> 00:06:00,700
[Nǐ ne?]

70
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:08,870
[Wǒ èr shí yī suì.]
[Wǒ èr shí yī suì.]

71
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,425
[Tā duō dà le?] [Tā duō dà le?]

72
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:25,230
[Tā shí bā suì.]
[Tā shí bā suì.]

73
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:32,280
Have you noticed there is a [ne]
after [nǐ]? What is it?

74
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,200
[Ne] is a particle which can be used
to ask reciprocal questions,

75
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,920
also known as bounce-back questions.

76
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:54,450
[Ne] can be used to form simple questions
asking what about or how about.

77
00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:00,945
The structure is, topic plus [ne].

78
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:06,690
For example, [Nǐ duō dà le?]

79
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,170
[Wǒ shí liù suì. Nǐ ne?]

80
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,480
[Wǒ èr shí qī suì.]

81
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,730
[Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuó rén?]

82
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,800
[Wǒ shì Zhōnɡɡuó rén. nǐ ne?]

83
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,240
We have learned [nǐ, wǒ, tā.]

84
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:43,935
Interestingly, the pronunciation for he
is the same as for she.

85
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:46,590
So, when I say [tā],

86
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:52,150
you actually don't know if I'm talking
about him or her.

87
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,910
That is really tricky, isn't it?

88
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:05,835
However, in writing, we don't have this
problem because they are different characters.

89
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:14,020
Have a look, [tā, tā.]

90
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,660
Now, let's do an exercise.

91
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,560
Listen to three statements.

92
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,300
The question is how old are they?

93
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:55,870
Number one, [Tā jiào Àobāmǎ.
Tā wǔ shí sì suì.]

94
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:15,510
Number two, [Tā jiào Zhāng Zǐyí.
Tā sān shí qī suì.]

95
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:36,720
Number three. [Tā jiào Lín Shūháo.
Tā èr shí bā suì.]

96
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:46,020
Okay. Can you tell me
[Tāmén duō dà le]?

97
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,330
Okay, let's see the answer,

98
00:09:51,110 --> 00:10:03,100
[Àobāmǎ duō dà le? Àobāmǎ wǔ shí sì suì.]

99
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:15,400
[Zhāng Zǐyí duō dà le? Tā sān shí qī suì.]

100
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,730
The last person,

101
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:29,700
[Lín Shūháo duō dà le? Tā èr shí bā suì.]

102
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,560
Did you get it?

103
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,880
We have learned so much today.

104
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,865
Have a good rest.

105
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:42,520
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
