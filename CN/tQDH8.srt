Nǐ yǒu māo mɑ？Nǐ de ɡǒu jiào shénme mínɡzi？]

4
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:24,309
[Nǐ de māo duōdà le?][Wǒ méiyǒu ɡǒu.]

5
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:30,002
[yě méiyǒu māo.] Actually, when I was young

6
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:35,315
[Wǒ yǒu ɡǒu，wǒ yě yǒu māo.]

7
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:40,260
Today we are going to read an e-mail from Lucy to Jenny.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,268
Both Lucy and
Jenny are learning Chinese now.

9
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:47,678
Listen to Lucy carefully.

10
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:52,013
Tell me what kind of
information you've got.

11
00:00:52,013 --> 00:01:02,013
—— Jenny,

12
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:14,856
[FOREIGN].

13
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,130
Lucy.

14
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,836
—— Lucy mentioned three
people in her email.

15
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:38,257
[Tāmen duōdà le?] One is [FOREIGN]
One is [FOREIGN] And

16
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:43,953
the last one is [FOREIGN]. Who are they then? A little

17
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:49,154
later you'll be clearer

18
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:55,355
about the content of the email.

19
00:01:57,772 --> 00:02:02,831
The first sentence from the email

20
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:07,529
is [FOREIGN] Beijng [FOREIGN] I'm

21
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:12,235
learning Chinese in Beijing.

22
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:18,427
[zài] Followed by a location,

23
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:23,380
comes before a wprd. It is to indicate the location

24
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,830
where an action or activity takes place.

25
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,940
This is one case that Chinese word
order is quite different from English.

26
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:44,128
The structure is subject, + [zài],

27
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:48,728
+ Place + Verb + Object.

28
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:53,982
More examples, [FOREIGN]

29
00:02:53,982 --> 00:03:00,490

[hànyǔ] is Chinese language.

35
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:32,970
We have learnt [ne] in [nǐ ne], but this
[ne] is very different.

36
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:40,671
In this sentence [ne] is to indicate
that an action is ongoing or in progress.

37
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:48,292
For example,

38
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:56,263
you could say [FOREIGN].

39
00:03:56,263 --> 00:04:01,299
[FOREIGN]
And

40
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:07,343
the structure

41
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:11,374
is here.

42
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:12,683
Okay?

43
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:14,941

47
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:21,691
Here are some more new words

48
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:27,355

[FOREIGN].

55
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:19,139
Can you give me more examples
by using [hé] to connect two words.

56
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,604
I have got three, you may have more.
