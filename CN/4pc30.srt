1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,971
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:11,587
[FOREIGN]
You can

3
00:00:11,587 --> 00:00:15,907
tell me your

4
00:00:15,907 --> 00:00:21,091
daily routine

5
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:27,920
in Chinese now.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,480
That's great.

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,650
Today we're going to learn the days
of the week and the birthdays.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:44,132
To ask what day of the week
is it today is [FOREIGN].

9
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:47,760
[FOREIGN] means week in Chinese.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,760
This is also used to indicate which
weekday you're talking about.

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,460
It's much easier to say days of
the week in Chinese than in English.

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,761
They are formed by the words
week followed by a number.

13
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:09,944
For example, Monday is [FOREIGN].

14
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:13,519
Tuesday is [FOREIGN].

15
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,736
What about Wednesday?

16
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:20,140
Yes, it's [FOREIGN].

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,995
Here is the table.

18
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:23,892
Read after me, please.

19
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:28,514
[FOREIGN]
or

20
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:33,137
[FOREIGN].

21
00:01:33,137 --> 00:01:39,130
As you can see,

22
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:48,826
Sunday is an exception.

23
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:52,600
It's [FOREIGN] or [FOREIGN].

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,661
You can't say [FOREIGN].

25
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:59,609
To answer the question [FOREIGN],

26
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:07,647
you just need to replace the date
with the question word, [FOREIGN].

27
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:13,552
For example,

28
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:17,983
[FOREIGN].

29
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:19,580
Let's watch a video.

30
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,026
Tell me the day and
the time they mention in the video.

31
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:31,790
>> [FOREIGN]
>> [FOREIGN]

32
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,310
>> [FOREIGN]

33
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:39,216
>> [FOREIGN]

34
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:39,820
>> Okay?

35
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:49,820
[FOREIGN]

36
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,130
What are they talking about?

37
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,930
You may have heard [FOREIGN].

38
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,853
A new word for
you is [FOREIGN] which means to go.

39
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,953
Read the whole conversation with me,
please.

40
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:14,927
[FOREIGN]
For

41
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:20,399
the question

42
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:24,876
[FOREIGN],

43
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:30,347
are you going

44
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:35,322
to school or

45
00:03:35,322 --> 00:03:41,296
university?

46
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:45,317
The answer is [FOREIGN].

47
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:49,922
In Chinese, we often use the verb
from the question for the answer.

48
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:56,494
For example, [FOREIGN].

49
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:58,696
If yes, you say [FOREIGN].

50
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:04,616
If not, you say [FOREIGN].

51
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:10,457
The answer could be [FOREIGN] or
[FOREIGN].

52
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:17,283
In Chinese,
a sentence with the nominal predicate is

53
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:21,476
a sentence whose predicate
is nominal element.

54
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:27,753
It's usually used to indicate age,
time, date, and so on.

55
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:34,220
For example

56
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,749
[FOREIGN]

57
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:48,198
There are a couple of new
words in dialogue two.

58
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:50,210
Read after me please.

59
00:04:50,210 --> 00:05:00,210
[FOREIGN].

60
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:13,922
Xiao Bei and are talking about birthday.

61
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:18,938
Listen to them and pay attention to
Xiao Bei's birthday in the video.

62
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:24,621
>> [FOREIGN]
>> [FOREIGN]

00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,184
>> [FOREIGN].

68
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:38,837
>> When is Xiao Bei's birthday?

69
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:43,308
[FOREIGN]

70
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:47,140
Are you

71
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,889
correct?

72
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,639
Please read the text with me.

73
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:03,616
[FOREIGN]

74
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:09,314
means

75
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:15,012
which

76
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:21,850
date?

77
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:28,263
You could also say [FOREIGN] means

78
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:33,733
which month, which date?

79
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:41,530
In Chinese days follow the order year,
month, day.

80
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,350
This goes from big to
small in Chinese culture.

81
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,277
Look at some examples.

82
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:49,548
The structure.

83
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:57,019
[FOREIGN]

84
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:05,556
Go on with

85
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:15,163
the text.

86
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:20,919
[FOREIGN]
That's

87
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,262
all for today,

88
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:32,428
I hope you enjoyed

89
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:39,832
the lesson, [FOREIGN]
