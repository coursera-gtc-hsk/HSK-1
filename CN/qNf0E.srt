I will ask you a couple

5
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:29,802
of questions from

00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:51,970
George, Chinese name [FOREIGN] has
a younger brother who is proud of himself.

10
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,130

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,200

18
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:39,578

[FOREIGN] By itself,

19
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:43,622

20
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:48,719
