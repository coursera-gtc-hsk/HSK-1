00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,651
[MUSIC]

00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:22,651
[Nǐ hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]
[Wǒ jiào Yú Bīn. Wǒ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì bā liù yāo ling liù èr qī wǔ(8610 6275).]
[nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]

3
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:25,100
We are going to learn
more greetings today.

4
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:29,480
So you could use the phrases
over the weekend,

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,730
if you have Chinese friends around.

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,030
There are five dialogues.

7
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:41,368
Dialogue 1, read after me, please.

8
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:48,227
[Tóngxué men hǎo!].
[Lǎoshī hǎo!]

9
00:00:48,227 --> 00:00:54,444
Almost every day when I step
into my classroom I say,

10
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:57,430
[Tóngxué men hǎo] to my students.

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,900
And my students say, [Lǎoshī hǎo] to me.

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,850
[Tóngxué men] is students or classmates.

13
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,590
[Lǎoshī]is teacher.

14
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,315
To make personal pronouns
including [Wǒ, nǐ, tā],

15
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:16,170
and [tā] plural.

16
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,720
all you need to do is add to the suffix

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,400
[men] to it.

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,200
Please have a look.

19
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,151
[wǒ men].

20
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:25,880
[nǐ men].

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,972
[tā men].

22
00:01:26,972 --> 00:01:30,032
[tā men].

23
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:36,120
When you use suffix [men],
it's only for people.

24
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,342
Not for any other things.

25
00:01:40,342 --> 00:01:47,816
Read with me please,

26
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,560
[wǒ men].[nǐ men].[tā men].[tā men].

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,899
For instance we can say, [tóngxué men].

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,910
And [hànzì men], no, you can't say that.

29
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,460
What about [péngyou men]?

30
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,210
Yeah, of course.

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,810
How about [gǒu men]?

32
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:15,870
No.

33
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:22,938
Now let's watch a video.

34
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:27,012
—— [Nǐ zěnmeyàng?]
—— [Wǒ hěn hǎo. Nǐ ne?]

35
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:29,561
—— [Wǒ yě hěn hǎo.]

36
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:32,913
—— The first sentence in the video is

37
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:35,314
[nǐ zěnmeyàng?], how are you?

38
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:40,905
[zěnmeyàng] is used to ask about
the condition of something or someone.

39
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:44,077
More examples.

40
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:54,077
[Tā zěnmeyàng?]
[Tiānqì zěnmeyàng?]
[Zhè ge zěnmeyàng?]

41
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:00,138
Read the text from dialogue one.

42
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:15,231
[nǐ zěnmeyàng?].
[Wǒ hěn hǎo. Nǐ ne?]
[Wǒ yě hěn hǎo.]

43
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:17,540
An exercise for you now.

44
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:24,790
Translate the English
phrases into Chinese.

45
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,270
Let's do it together.

46
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,090
Number one, I'm fine.

47
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,200
How do you say that?

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,842
Yes, [Wǒ hěn hǎo].

49
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:43,725
Number two, teacher, students.

50
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:49,552
[Lǎoshī, tóngxué men].

51
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:53,783
The last one, how are you?

52
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:58,215
[Nǐ zěnmeyàng?].

53
00:03:58,215 --> 00:04:00,265
Do you get it?

54
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:03,230
You may know how to say thank you.

55
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,704
But how do you say, you're welcome?

56
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,722
Have a look, then.

57
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:12,269
—— [Xièxie!]
—— [Bú kèqi!]

58
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,850
—— [Xièxie] means thank you.

59
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:20,229
The second [Xiè] in
[Xièxie] is neutral tone.

60
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:24,879
[Bú kèqi] means you're welcome or
not at all.

61
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,811
[qi] in [Bú kèqi] is also soft tone.

62
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,930
Read after me please.

63
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:42,755
[Xièxie!][Bú kèqi!]
[Xièxie!][Bú kèqi!]

64
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:45,218
Dialogue 4 for you.

65
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:50,990
—— [Oh, Duìbuqǐ!]
—— [Méi guānxi!]

66
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,610
—— What did they say?

67
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,180
Yes, they said, I'm sorry.

68
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,884
That's all right, no problem.

69
00:04:57,884 --> 00:05:02,631
Follow me, please.

70
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:13,288
[Duìbuqǐ!][Méi guānxi!]
[Duìbuqǐ!][Méi guānxi!]

71
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:16,220
There are two syllables
with a neutral tone.

72
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,018
One is [bù] in [Duìbuqǐ],

73
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:25,720
another one is [xì] in [Méi guānxi].

74
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,910
The last dialogue for you is,

75
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,025

—— [Qiáozhì, zaìjiàn!]

00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:37,079
—— [Míngtiān jiàn!]

77
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,909
[Zaìjiàn!][Míngtiān jiàn!]

78
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,684
[zaì] means again.

79
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:53,620
[jiàn] means to see, you learned
[Míngtiān] in last lesson is tomorrow.

80
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,306
So the two phrases are see you again,
see you tomorrow.

81
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:02,969

82
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:11,047

83
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:14,691
That's all for today.

84
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:20,919
[Xièxie!]
[Zaìjiàn!]
