[Bùnéng, tā hòutiān shàngwǔ huí.]

00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:35,991
[Tāmen shénme shíhou qù mǎi yīfu?]
[Hòutiān xiàwǔ.]

38
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:50,185
So many questions. [Nǐ dá duì le mɑ?]
Please read the text with me.

39
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:58,685
>> [Míngtiān nǐ qù nǎr?]
>> [Wǒ qù kàn yī gè péngyou.]

40
00:03:50,185 --> 00:04:05,305
>> [Nǐ zěnme qù?]
>> [Zuò chūzū chē qù.]

41
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:17,945
>> [Nǐ yī gè rén qù ma?]
>> [Bù, wǒ hé wǒ de nán péngyou yīqǐ qù.]

42
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:23,749
[zuò] is to sit.

43
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:30,023
We learned [qǐnɡ zuò] ,
which means sit down, please.

44
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:35,700
What about [zuò chūzū chē] in the dialogue?

45
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,965
Literally, it means, sit in the taxi.

46
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:44,073
[Wǒ zuò chūzū chē qù.]

47
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:47,845
It's I go by taxi.

48
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:56,140
The preposition [hé] is
commonly used to express 'with'.

49
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,110
Remember, the 'with' phrase
should come before the verb.

50
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,387
The structure is,

51
00:05:08,387 -->  00:05:20,238
subject + [hé] + person + verb + object

52
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:29,933
For example, [zuótiān wǒ hé mèimei
qù diànyǐngyuàn kàn diànyǐng le.]

53
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:43,883
[wǒ xǐhuan hé bàba māma liáotiānr.]
The word [yìqǐ] is used a lot with

54
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:48,371
[hé] expressing the idea of doing

55
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:52,869
something together with somebody.

56
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:57,751
The structure is, subject + [hé]
 + person + [yìqǐ] + verb + object.

57
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:03,058
The structure is, subject + [hé]
 + person + [yìqǐ] + verb + object.

58
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:08,802
The structure is, subject + [hé]
 + person + [yìqǐ] + verb + object.

59
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:17,854
For example,
[wǒ hé jiějie yīqǐ zuò chūzū chē huíjiā.]

60
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:23,137
[wǒ hé māma yīqǐ chī wǔfàn.]

61
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:29,281
Go on with the text.

62
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:37,363
>> [Nǐ míngtiān xiàwǔ néng huílái ma?]
>> [Bùnéng, wǒ hòutiān shàngwǔ huí.]

63
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:41,648
>> [Wǒmen shénme shíhou qù mǎi yīfu?]

64
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:45,837
>> [Hòutiān xiàwǔ kěyǐ ma?]

65
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:52,407
>> [Kěyǐ, wǒmen qù nǎgè shāngdiàn?]

66
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:56,398
Okay, a few questions for you.

67
00:06:56,398 --> 00:07:01,313
You can answer these questions
according to your own situation.

68
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:12,453
[Míngtiān nǐ qù nǎr?]
[Nǐ zěnme qù?]

69
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:16,871
[Nǐ hé nǐ nán péngyou / ]

70
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:22,324
[nǚ péngyou] or somebody else [yīqǐ qù ma?]

71
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:25,477
[Nǐ shénme shíhou huílái?]

72
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:30,640
That's all for today.

73
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,020
Hope you enjoyed the lesson.

74
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,553
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
