1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,958
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:11,662
[Nǐ hǎo! Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:16,840
[Nǐ xǐhuan zài wǎngshang mǎi dōngxī ma?]

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,546
[Nǐ zài wǎngshang mài shénme dōngxi?]

5
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:26,722
[Wǒ huì zuò zhōngguó cài, Nǐ huì ma?]
[Nǐ xiǎng xué ma?]

6
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:32,847
In this lesson, we are going
to talk about Chinese food.

7
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:37,260
The title of this lesson is,
[wǒ huì zuò zhōngguó cài].

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,253
The title of this lesson is,
[wǒ huì zuò zhōngguó cài].

9
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:49,490
Let's learn some new words.

10
00:00:49,490 --> 00:01:20,029
[wèi] [zhè jǐ tiān] [zuò fàn]
[xué huì] [qǐng] [ā] [néng] [zhù]

11
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,735
[wèi] means hello.

12
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:27,902
You used it especially
when making a phone call.

13
00:01:27,902 --> 00:01:35,939
It's the fourth tone, but the way often
say [wéi] instead of [wèi].

14
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:43,437
[zhè jǐ tiān] means these days, recently.

15
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,165
What are you doing these days?

16
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:51,913
[Zhè jǐ tiān nǐ zuò shén me ne?]
what are you reading these days?

17
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:56,489
[Zhè jǐ tiān nǐ zài dú shénme shū?]

18
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:03,680
[xué huì]
[xué] is to learn.

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,698
If you have learned and got it,
you need to add [huì] after [xué].

20
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:12,507
That is [xué huì].

21
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:17,364
For example, [wǒ xué huì le zuò fàn.]
I've learned cooking.

22
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:26,076
Can I learn to write Chinese
characters? [Wǒ néng xuéhuì xiě hànzì ma?]

23
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:30,002
of course, you can.

24
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:32,731
[qǐng] is to invite.

25
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:40,986
We've learned [qǐng] in [qǐng zuò],
[qǐng hē chá], that means please.

26
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:48,879
In this sentence, [wǒ qǐng nǐ chīfàn],
[qǐng] means to invite.

27
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:56,824
[a] is sentence-final interjection here.

28
00:02:56,824 --> 00:03:00,457
The interjection [a] is often added to the end

29
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:05,938
of sentences to add a term of exclamation,

30
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:09,149
urgency or excitement.

31
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:16,080
The exact meaning often
depends on the context.

32
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,533
For example, [hǎo a] means good,
fine, okay.

33
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:26,664
[duì a], you're right.

34
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:31,130
[shì a], definitely, I think so too.

35
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:40,102
[néng] is used to
emphasize one's ability or

36
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:45,121
the possibility of something to happen.

37
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,543
The structure,

38
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:57,515
Subject + [néng] + verb + object.

39
00:03:57,515 --> 00:04:05,562
For example,
[nǐ néng zài zhèr xiě nǐ de zhōngwén míngzì ma?]

40
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:08,341
a long sentence.

41
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:14,014
[Jīntiān xiàwǔ nǐ néng lái ma?]

42
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:21,745
Video time, Xiaopei and Xiaobei

43
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:26,060
are talking on the phone.

44
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,190
Listen to their conversation and

45
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,778
then try to give answers
to the questions below.

46
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:41,172
>> [Wèi! Nǐhǎo! Wǒ shì Xiǎobèi, shì xiǎopéi ma?]
>> [Duì, wǒ shì xiǎopéi. Xiǎobèi, nǐ zěnmeyàng?]

47
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:44,259
>> [Wǒ hěn hǎo. Wǒ zhèjǐtiān xué zuòfàn ne!]

48
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,456
>> [Shìma? nǐ xuéhuì le ma?]

49
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:51,048
>> [Xuéhuì le, wǒ xiǎng qǐng nǐ hé
xiǎoyuè lái wǒ jiā chīfàn.]

50
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:53,892
>> [Hǎo a! Xièxiè! Shénme shíhou?]

51
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:56,908
>> [Xīngqīliù xiàwǔ nǐmen néng lái ma?]

52
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:59,323
>> [Néng, jǐ diǎn ya?]

53
00:04:59,323 --> 00:05:01,020
>> [Wǔ diǎn kěyǐ ma?]

54
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,169
>> [Kěyǐ, xīngqīliù jiàn. Nǐ zhù zài nǎr?]

55
00:05:06,451 --> 00:05:10,336
Okay, let's look at the answers.

56
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:26,859
[Xiǎobèi, zhèjǐtiān xué shénme ne?]
[xué zuòfàn]

57
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:32,398
The next one, what for?

58
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:38,656
[chīfàn]

59
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:48,811
And the third one, [tāmen néng lái].

60
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:57,437
and the last one, [xīngqīliù wǔ diǎn].

61
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:07,051
[Nǐ dá duì le ma?]
Now, read text with me.

62
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:21,888
>> [Wèi, nǐhǎo. Wǒ shì xiǎobèi, shì xiǎopéi ma?]
>> [Duì, wǒ shì xiǎopéi, xiǎobèi, nǐ zěnmeyàng?]

63
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:34,488
>> [Wǒ hěn hǎo. Wǒ zhèjǐtiān xué zuòfàn ne!]
>> [Shìma, nǐ xuéhuì le ma?]

64
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:43,388
>> [Xuéhuì le, wǒ xiǎng qǐng nǐ hé
xiǎoyuè lái wǒ jiā chīfàn.]

65
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:57,388
>> [Hǎo a! xièxiè! Shénme shíhou?]
>> [Xīngqīliù xiàwǔ nǐmen néng lái ma?]

66
00:06:57,388 --> 00:07:12,388
>> [Néng, jǐ diǎn ya?] >> [Wǔ diǎn kěyǐ ma?]
>> [Kěyǐ, xīngqīliù jiàn. Nǐ zhù zài nǎr?]

67
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:19,530
Let's do an exercise now.

68
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,666
Match the questions and answers.

69
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,230
Okay, number one,

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,546
[Nǐ xué shénme ne?]
[Xué zuò zhōngguó fàn ne.]

71
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:45,955
Number two, [Nǐ shénme shíhòu lái wǒ jiā?]

72
00:07:45,955 --> 00:07:51,201
[Míngtiān xiàwǔ sān diǎn.]

73
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:56,616
Number three, [nǐ zhù zài nàr?]

74
00:07:56,616 --> 00:08:00,367

Number four, [nǐ mǎi le shénme?]
[Kāfēi.]

76
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:14,561
The last one, [zhè jiàn yī fú duō shǎo qián?]

77
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:18,203
[Bāshíqī kuài.]

78
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,783
Sorry we don't have enough time to read,

79
00:08:24,783 --> 00:08:27,849
but please look at it again later.

80
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:36,255
This type of question is
the same as that in Reading

81
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:41,037
Comprehension Part 3
HSK Test level 1.

82
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:44,400
There are five items in part 3.

00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:03,297
Time to say byebye.

87
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:05,482
Hope you enjoyed the lesson.

88
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:08,304
