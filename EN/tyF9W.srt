1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,284
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,284 --> 00:00:12,030
[Tóngxuémen hǎo! Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,955
After learning Chinese for

4
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:23,771
a week, now you can tell me
[Nǐ jiào shénme mínɡzi?]
[Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuó rén? Nǐ duō dà le?]

5
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:28,294
[Nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]

6
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,459
You can also say

7
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:40,814
[Lǎoshī hǎo! Nǐ zěnmeyànɡ?]
[Xièxie! Búkèqi! Duìbuqǐ! Méiɡuānxi!]

8
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:45,390
[Zàijiàn!] and so on. That's great.

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,018
In this week, we're going to talk
about family, school or university.

10
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,915
Let's start from lesson one.

11
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:58,408
[Tā shì shéi？] Look at the picture.

12
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:10,180
There are [bàba, māma, gēge, mèimei].

13
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:14,247
Please read with me.

14
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:22,292
[bàba, māma, gēge, mèimei.]

15
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:27,530
Pay attention to the second syllable of each word.

16
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,163
They are all neutral tone.

17
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:36,371
Let's watch a video and
see how Xudong introduces his family.

18
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:44,740
>> [Xù dōng, tā shì shéi?]
>> [Tā shì wǒ māma, jīn nián sì shí liù suì.]

19
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:53,975
>> [Tā shì shéi?]
>> [Tā shì wǒ mèimei, jīn nián shí jiǔ suì.]

20
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:57,257
>> [Nǐ mèi mèi hěn piào liàng.]
>> [Xiè xie]

21
00:01:57,257 --> 00:02:06,893
>> [Zhègèrén shì shéi?]
>> [Zhègèrén shì wǒ bàba. Tā jīn nián wǔ shí suì.]

22
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:12,398
>> How many people are there in Xudong's family?

23
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:18,322
[Duì，sì kǒu rén.]
There are four people.

24
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:28,541
[Bàbɑ, māmɑ, mèimei] and [Xùdōng].
[Tāmen duōdà le？]

25
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:37,422
[Māmɑ duōdà? Māmɑ sì shí liù suì.]

26
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:43,580
[Bàbɑ duōdà? Bàbɑ wǔ shí suì.]

27
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:53,294
[Mèimei duōdà? Mèimei shí jiǔ suì.]

28
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:58,910
Let's see the whole text of the video.

29
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,722
Read after me please.

30
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:15,817
>> [Xù dōng, tā shì shéi?]
>> [Tā shì wǒ māma. Tā jīn nián sì shí liù suì.]

31
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:28,313
>> [Tā shì shéi?]
>> [Tā shì wǒ mèimei. Tā jīn nián shí jiǔ suì.]

32
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:37,644
[shéi] means who or whom. We learned
[shénme] [nǎ] in previous lessons.

33
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:41,644
[shéi] is another wh-word.

34
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:48,242
[jīnnián] is this year.
[Tā jīn nián sì shí liù suì]

35
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:54,353
Why we say 'this year' while talking
about people's age in Chinese?

36
00:03:54,353 --> 00:04:00,187
It's because in Chinese culture,
your age changes when it's New Year,

37
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:05,851
no matter when your birthday is.

38
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:15,827
Read after me please.
[Nǐ mèi mèi hěn piào liàng.] [Xiè xie]

39
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:29,910
>> [Zhègèrén shì shéi?]
>> [Zhègèrén shì wǒ bàba. Tā jīn nián wǔ shí suì.]

40
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,124
[piàoliɑnɡ] is pretty or beautiful.

41
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:39,084
[Zhè ɡe rén] means this person.

42
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,729
Let's do an exercise.

43
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:50,167
Look at the picture and ask questions as many
as you can about the person in the picture.

44
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:56,852
I think at least now you're able
to ask five questions in Chinese.

45
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:09,918
[Tā shì shéi?] [Zhègèrén shì shéi?]

46
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,239
[Tā jiào shénme mínɡzi?]

47
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:19,239
[Tā shì nǎ ɡuó rén?]

48
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:24,239
[Tā duō dà le?]

49
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:31,239
[Tā Nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]

50
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:36,762
Okay. How do you answer the questions?

51
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:40,140
Please have a try by yourself.

52
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:49,978
Another exercise for you.
Match the questions and answers.

53
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:55,131
Number one. [Tāmen shì shéi?]

54
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:05,712
[Bàba hé māma.]

55
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:14,877
Number two. [nǐmèimei jīnnián duō dà le?]

56
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:17,542
[Shí èr suì.]

57
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:23,161
Number three. [Tā de tóngxué piàoliang mā?]

58
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:32,071
[Hěn piào liàng.]
Are you correct?

59
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:39,364
That's all for today. See you soon.
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
