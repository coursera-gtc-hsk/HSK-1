3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,955
After learning Chinese for

00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:23,771
a week, now you can tell me
[Nǐ jiào shénme mínɡzi? Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuó rén? Nǐ duō dà le?]

00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:28,294
[Nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]

6
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:33,459
You can also say

7
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:39,814
[Lǎoshī hǎo! Nǐ zěnmeyànɡ? Xièxie! Búkèqi! Duìbuqǐ! Méiɡuānxi!]

8
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:45,390
[Zàijiàn!] and so on. That's great.

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,018
In this week, we're going to talk
about family, school or university.

10
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,915
Let's start from lesson one.

11
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:58,408
[Tā shì shéi？] Look at the picture.

12
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:04,180
There are bàba, māma, gēge, mèimei.

13
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:14,247
Please read with me.

14
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:22,292
[bàba, māma, gēge, mèimei.]

15
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:27,530
Pay attention to the second syllable of each word.

16
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,163
They are all neutral tone.

17
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:36,371
Let's watch a video and
see how Xudong introduces his family.

18
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:40,740
>> [Xù dōng, tā shì shéi?]

19
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:47,022
>> [Tā shì wǒ māma, jīn nián sì shí liù suì.]

20
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:49,059
>> [Tā shì shéi?]

21
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:51,497
>> [FOREIGN]

22
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:53,975
>> [Tā shì wǒ mèimei, jīn nián shí jiǔ suì.]

23
00:01:57,257 --> 00:02:00,100
>> [FOREIGN]

24
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,893
>> How many people are there

25
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:12,398
in Xudong's family?

26
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:18,322
[Duì，sì kǒu (口, measure word for people, especially for family members) rén.]
There are four people.

27
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:22,541
[bàbɑ, māmɑ, mèimei] and [Xudong].
[Tāmen duōdà le？]

28
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,346
[FOREIGN]

29
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:33,422
[FOREIGN]

30
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:41,580
[FOREIGN]

31
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,164
[FOREIGN]

32
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:53,294
[FOREIGN]

33
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:59,410
[FOREIGN] Let's see the whole text of the video.

34
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,722
Read after me please.

35
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:12,817
[FOREIGN]

36
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:19,313
[FOREIGN]

37
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:25,808
[FOREIGN]

38
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:33,606
[FOREIGN]

39
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:41,644
[shéi] means who or whom. We learned [shénme] [nǎ] in previous lessons. [shéi] is another wh-word.

40
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:48,242
[jīnnián] is this year. [FOREIGN]

41
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:54,353
Why we say 'this year' while talking
about people's age in Chinese?

42
00:03:54,353 --> 00:04:02,187
It's because in Chinese culture,

43
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:10,541
your age changes when it's New Year,

44
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:17,851
no matter when your birthday is.

45
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:22,827
Read after me please. [FOREIGN].

46
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:24,910
[FOREIGN].

47
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:32,124
[FOREIGN]. [piàoliɑnɡ] is pretty or beautiful.

48
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:39,084
[Zhè ɡe rén]
means this person.

49
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,729
Let's do an exercise.

50
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:50,167
Look at the picture and ask questions as many
as you can about the person in the picture.

51
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:56,852
I think at least now you're able
to ask five questions in Chinese.

52
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:05,918
[FOREIGN]

53
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:24,239
[FOREIGN]

54
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:33,084
[FOREIGN] Okay.

55
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:37,262
How do you answer the questions?

56
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:40,140
Please have a try by yourself.

57
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:44,550
Another exercise for you.

58
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,978
Match the questions and answers.

59
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,801
Number one.

[FOREIGN]

63
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:11,877
Number two

64
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:18,042
[FOREIGN].

65
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:22,161

67
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:33,071
