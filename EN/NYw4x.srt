00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:07,091
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:12,534
[Tónɡxuémen hǎo! Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:19,653
[Wǒmen xuéxí le shànɡmiàn, xiàmiàn,
qiánmiàn, hòumiàn]

4
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:25,934
[lǐmiàn, wàimiàn] Can you use

5
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:30,546
these direction words to make some sentences?

6
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:34,546
[Qǐnɡ tīnɡ wǒ shuō.]

7
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:42,544
[Wǒ de xiǎo māo zài zhuōzi shànɡmiàn.
Wǒ de shū zài yǐzi xiàmiàn.]

8
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:48,828
[Shǒujī zài nǐ de shūbāo lǐmiàn.]

9
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:55,541
[Nǐ de pénɡyou zài xuéxiào wàimiàn.]
[Tā de tónɡxué zài shānɡdiàn lǐmiàn.]

10
00:00:55,541 --> 00:01:01,397
[Tā jiā zài wǒ jiā hòumiàn.]

11
00:01:01,397 --> 00:01:11,120
[Nǐ tīnɡdǒnɡ le mɑ?] Do you understand?
I am actually confused by those words and the sentences.

12
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,833
Anyway, you will have something new for
today, the topic for this lesson is

13
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,032
Anyway, you will have something new for
today, the topic for this lesson is

14
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:27,730
[Tài měi le!] So beautiful!

15
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:33,009
Tingna and Hailiang
are talking about the Great Wall.

16
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:40,048
Listen carefully and
pay attention to the questions below.

17
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:43,520
>> [Zhè shì bādálǐng chángchéng ma?] >> [Shì a.]

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,758
>> [Tài měi le! Bādálǐng chángchéng zài nǎr?]

19
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:51,348
>> [Zài běijīng de xīběi.
Wǒmen jiào jǐ gè tóngxué yīqǐ qù ba?]

20
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:53,373
>> [Hǎo a! Nǎtiān qù?]

21
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:55,900
>> [Zhège xīngqīliù zěnme yàng?]

22
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,961
>> [Hǎo, wǒmen zěnme qù ne?]

23
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:01,101
>> [Nǐ xué chē le ma? Wǒmen kāichē qù ba!]

24
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:10,178
>> [Xuéle! hǎode, wǒ kāichē, nǐmen zuòchē,
wǒmen yīqǐ qù bādálǐng chángchéng!]

25
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:13,287
Okay, let's see the answers.

26
00:02:19,742 --> 00:02:28,190
[Chánɡchénɡ de mínɡzi shì?]
[Bādálǐng chángchéng.]

27
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:35,768
[Bādálǐnɡ chánɡchénɡ zài nǎr?]

28
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:47,403
[Zài běijīng de xīběi.]
[Tāmen nǎtiān qù chánɡchénɡ?]

29
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:54,100
[Xīngqīliù.] Now,

30
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:02,137
[Tāmen zěnme qù?] [Tāmen kāichē qù.]

31
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:11,513
[Tínɡnà huì kāichē mɑ?]

32
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:19,550
[Tā huì kāichē.] [Shéi zuòchē?]

33
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:30,269
[Hǎiliàng hé tóngxuémen.]
Now go over the text with me please.

34
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:42,269
>> [Zhè shì bādálǐng chángchéng ma?] >> [Shì a.]
>> [Tài měi le! Bādálǐng chángchéng zài nǎr?]

35
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:52,269
>> [Zài běijīng de xīběi.
Wǒmen jiào jǐ gè tóngxué yīqǐ qù ba?]

36
00:03:52,269 --> 00:04:01,269
>> [Hǎo a! Nǎtiān qù?]
>> [Zhège xīngqīliù zěnme yàng?]

37
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:07,254
[chánɡchénɡ] is the Great Wall.

38
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:13,662
[Bādálǐnɡ] is the name of
a section of the Great Wall.

39
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:22,858
There are also Mutianyu Chanɡchenɡ,
Sīmatai Chanɡcheng etc. in Beijing.

40
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:31,580
[měi] is beautiful.
[Wǒmen kéyǐ shuō, chánɡchénɡ hěn měi.]

41
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:42,243
[Nàɡe nǚrén hěn měi], [Hànzì hěn měi] and so on.
[xīběi] is northwest.

42
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:44,702
[xī] is west,

43
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:52,067
[běi] is north, [dōnɡ] is east,
[nán] is south.

44
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:56,800
[jǐɡè], several, a few.

45
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,748
We learnt [jǐ] in

46
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:05,647
[jǐ diǎn] [xīnɡqī jǐ], but this one is different.

47
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:12,751
For example, [Shūbāo lǐ yǒu jǐ ɡè pínɡɡuǒ.]

48
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:18,750
This sentence is a statement which means

49
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:25,983
there are a few apples in the school bag.
However, if you raise the intonation a bit,

50
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:31,099
the sentence becomes a question, that is

51
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:38,699
[Shūbāo lǐ yǒu jǐ ɡè pínɡɡuǒ?]

52
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,168
Okay, go on with the text.

53
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:54,168
>> [Hǎo, wǒmen zěnme qù ne?]
>> [Nǐ xuéhuì kāichē le ma? Wǒmen kāichē qù ba!]

54
00:05:54,168 --> 00:06:10,168
>> [wǒ xué huì kāi chē le. Hǎode, wǒ kāichē,
nǐmen zuòchē, wǒmen yīqǐ qù bādálǐng chángchéng!]

55
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:17,341
Sentences like [Wǒmen jiào jǐ ɡè tónɡxué yìqǐ qù bɑ!]
is called pivotal sentence.

56
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:22,121
Sentences like [Wǒmen jiào jǐ ɡè tónɡxué yìqǐ qù bɑ!]
is called pivotal sentence.

57
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:26,081
A pivotal sentence has two predicates.

58
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:30,858
The first of which has an object that serves

59
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:35,511
as the subject for the second predicate.

60
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:42,713
The structure is, subject + verb 1
+ pivotal word + verb 2 + object.

61
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:49,521
The structure is, subject + verb 1
+ pivotal word + verb 2 + object.

62
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:55,488
For example, [wǒ qǐng péngyou lái chīfàn].

63
00:06:56,963 --> 00:07:01,314
[Tā jiào nǚ‘ér xiě hànzì].

64
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:06,756
[ne] can be with questions.

65
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:10,654
Involving interrogative pronouns,

66
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:15,718
like [nǎr], [shéi], [zěnme], [shénme] etc.

67
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:21,572
to soften the tone of the question.

68
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:24,572
The structure is,
interrogative pronoun + [ne].

69
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:30,392
The structure is,
interrogative pronoun + [ne].

70
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:38,762
For example, [wǒ men zěnme qù ne?]
[Tāmen zuò shénme ne?]

71
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:45,042
[Wǒ de hànyǔ shū zài nǎr ne?]

72
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,197
Time flies.

73
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:55,970
Six weeks passed since you've
started to learn Chinese with me.

74
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,770
Hope you'll find that this
course useful and enjoyable.

75
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,085
I sincerely hope you can keep
going with your Chinese study.

76
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:12,635
My colleagues from the School of
Chinese as a second language of

77
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:19,980
Peking University will continue to teach
you for higher levels in the near future.

78
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,587
[Xièxie nǐmen! Tónɡxuémen, zàijiàn!]
