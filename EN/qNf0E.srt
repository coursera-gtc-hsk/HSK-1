00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,848
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:12,508
[Tónɡxuémen hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:19,425
[Wǒ jiào yú bīn.] [Nǐ de xué xiào dà me?]
[Nǐ de lǎo shī jiào shén me míngzi?]

4
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:25,084
[Tā duō dà le?] [Tā yǒu érzi hé nǚér me?]

5
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:30,302
For each time when I start a new lesson,

6
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:35,390
I will ask you a couple of questions from
the last lesson.

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,278
Please try to give me your
answers to the questions.

8
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:44,050
Today, we are going to talk
about Chinese learning.

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:51,970
George, Chinese name is [qiáo zhì], has
a younger brother who is proud of himself.

10
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,200
Why? You will find out after watching a video.

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,555
Before that, let's go over the new words.

12
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:05,948
Read after me please.

13
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:15,948
[dìdi] [huì] [shuō]

14
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,124
[yīdiǎnr] [kù]

15
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:31,120
[duì] [huì] is can.

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,274
How do you say cannot?

17
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:39,578
It's [bú huì] We learned [bu] in
[duìbùqǐ, búkèqi]

18
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:44,122
By itself, [bù] means no, not.

19
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:48,719
Not good is [bùhǎo].

20
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,860
Not happy is [bù gāoxìng]
[yīdiǎnr], a little.

21
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,960
I can speak a little Chinese.

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,215
[Wǒ huì shuō yī diǎnr hànyǔ.]

23
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:07,079
[kù] is cool.

24
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,359
It's translated according to
the sound of the English word, cool.

25
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:16,391
[duì] means correct, right.

26
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:19,372
When we say yes in Chinese,

27
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:25,450
we say [duì] more than [shì].

28
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:35,169
[xiě] [hànzì] [tài ... le]

29
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:40,397
[zěn me]

30
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:47,870
[dú] [běijīng dàxué]

31
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,115
[tài ... le] means very, too.

32
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:59,143
In between [tài] and [le]
you could place an adjective or

33
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:01,280
a psychological verb.

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,200
For example, [tài hǎo le]
[tài gāo xìng le]

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,469
[zěn me] means how.

36
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:19,738
How to speak is [zěnme shuō]
How to write is [zěnme xiě]

37
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:23,283
How to read is [zěnme dú]

38
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:30,133

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,623

>> [Běijīng dàxué.]

44
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:08,222
