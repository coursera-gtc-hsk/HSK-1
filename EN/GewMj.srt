[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:11,333
[Tónɡxuémen hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:16,568
[Jīntiān shì jǐ yuè jǐ hào？Jīntiān xīnɡqī jǐ？]

4
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:23,541
[Nǐ de shēnɡrì shì jǐ yuè jǐ hào？]
'Happy birthday!' [zěnme shuō]?

5
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:29,017
Can you sing the song
'happy birthday' in Chinese?

6
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:32,426
In this lesson we're going
to learn some new words and

7
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:35,010
expressions about weather in Chinese.

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,600
Listen to dialogue one.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:46,008
>> [Míngtiān tiānqì zěnmeyàng？]
>> [Bùtàihǎo, míngtiān yǒu yǔ.]

10
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:48,655
What are they talking about?

11
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:51,697
Yes, the weather.

12
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:57,553
Let's read the text.

13
00:00:57,553 --> 00:01:06,637
>> [Míngtiān tiānqì zěnmeyàng？]

14
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:10,529
>> [Bùtàihǎo, míngtiān yǒu yǔ.]

15
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:20,210
>> [Bùtàihǎo, míngtiān yǒu yǔ.]

16
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,080
[tiānqì] is weather.[yǔ] Is rain.

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,220
The meaning of the question is
what is the weather like tomorrow?

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,830
And the answer, word by
word, is not very good.

19
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,000
Tomorrow has rain.

20
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,974
Read again with me, please.

21
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:49,405
>> [Míngtiān tiānqì zěnmeyàng？]
>> [Bùtàihǎo, míngtiān yǒu yǔ.]

22
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:52,060
Now listen to dialogue two.

23
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,051
>> [Xiàyǔ le!]
>> [Shén me! Xiàyǔ le? Wǒ de diànnǎo zài wàimiàn ne!]

24
00:01:59,051 --> 00:01:59,621
From the picture,
you may guess what is happening now.

25
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:02,950
From the picture,
you may guess what is happening now.

26
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,590
Yes, it's raining, but
the computer is outside.

27
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,940
Read the text with me, please.

28
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:21,277
>> [Xiàyǔ le!]
>> [Shén me! Xiàyǔ le? Wǒ de diànnǎo zài wàimiàn ne!]

29
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:24,335
Again.

30
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:28,767
>> [Xiàyǔ le!]
>> [Shén me! Xiàyǔ le? Wǒ de diànnǎo zài wàimiàn ne!]

31
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:33,965
>> [Xiàyǔ le!]
>> [Shén me! Xiàyǔ le? Wǒ de diànnǎo zài wàimiàn ne!]

32
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:40,800
[Xià yǔ le] means it's raining,
like we learned some time ago,

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,146
[le] indicates change of situation or
starting a new situation.

34
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:51,730
[diànnǎo] is computer and
[wàimiàn] is outside.

35
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:58,223
In a sentence [Wǒ de diànnǎo zài wàimiàn ne!],
[zài] is a verb,

36
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:02,228
expressing existence in a location,

37
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:06,916
similar to how we say in
English, 'to be at' or 'to be in'.

38
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:16,060
For example, [Wǒ zài běi jīng.]
[Tā zài shàng hǎi.]

39
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,420
For example, [Wǒ zài běi jīng.]
[Tā zài shàng hǎi.]

40
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,580
In dialogue three,
it mentions two places in China.

41
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,810
One is Guangzhou, a big city in Southern China.

42
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,490
Harbin a city in the Northeast.

43
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,909
Let's learn some new words.

44
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:46,119
[rè] [lěng] [yǒu diǎnr] [guǎngzhōu] [hā'ěrbīn]

45
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:51,162

46
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:59,247
[rè] [lěng] [yǒu diǎnr] [guǎngzhōu] [hā'ěrbīn]

47
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:02,628
We're going to listen to dialogue three.

48
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:07,414
Pay attention to the weather
in the two cities.

49
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:11,183
>> [Guǎngzhōu de tiānqì zěnmeyàng?]
>> [Tài rè le.]

50
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:12,280
>> [hā'ěr bīn ne?]
>> [Yǒu diǎnr lěng.]

51
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,975
>> [hā'ěr bīn ne?]
>> [Yǒu diǎnr lěng.]

52
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:22,681
[Guǎnɡzhōu de tiānqì zěnmeyànɡ?]

53
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:29,452
The answer? [Tài rè le!]

54
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:33,222
The answer? [Tài rè le!]

55
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:37,983
[Hā'ěrbīn de tiānqì zěnmeyànɡ?]

56
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:46,753
[Yǒu diǎnr lěnɡ.]

57
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:51,270
[yǒu diǎnr] is a little, a bit.

58
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,290
Usually indicating something unpleasant or
undesired.

59
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:03,183
The structure is [yǒu diǎnr] + adjective
or psychological verb.

60
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:07,598
The structure is [yǒu diǎnr] + adjective
or psychological verb.

61
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,463
Examples here.

62
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:18,677
[Tiānqì yǒudiǎnr rè.]
[Wǒ de péngyǒu yǒu diǎnr bù gāoxìng.]

63
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:29,287
