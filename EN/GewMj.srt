[Tónɡxuémen hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:15,068
[Jīntiān shì jǐ yuè jǐ hào？Jīntiān xīnɡqī jǐ？] 

4
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:22,541
[Nǐ de shēnɡrì shì jǐ yuè jǐ hào？] 'Happy birthday!' [zěnme shuō]? 

5
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:29,017
Can you sing the song
'happy birthday' in Chinese?

6
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:32,426
In this lesson we're going
to learn some new words and

7
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:35,010
expressions about weather in Chinese.

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,600
Listen to dialogue one.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:46,008
>> [FOREIGN]
>> [FOREIGN]

10
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:48,655
>> What are they talking about?

11
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:51,697
Yes, the weather.

12
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:57,553
Let's read the text.

13
00:00:57,553 --> 00:01:06,637
[FOREIGN]

14
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:10,529
[tiānqì] is

15
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:20,529
weather.

16
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,080
[yǔ] Is rain.

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,220
The meaning of the question is
what is the weather like tomorrow?

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,830
And the answer word by
word is not very good.

19
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,000
Tomorrow has rain.

20
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,974
Read again with me, please.

21
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:44,905
[FOREIGN]

22
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:52,060
Now listen to dialog two.

23
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,051
>> [FOREIGN]
>> [FOREIGN]

24
00:01:59,051 --> 00:01:59,621
>> From the picture,

25
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:00,950
you may guess what is happening now.

26
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,590
Yes, it's raining, but
the computer is outside.

27
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,940
Read the text with me, please.

28
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:17,277
[FOREIGN]

29
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:24,335

00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:28,767
[Xià yǔ le]
means

31
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:34,465
it's raining, like we

32
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:40,800
learned some time ago,

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,146
[le] indicates change of situation or
starting a new situation.

34
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:53,230
[diànnǎo] is computer and
[wàimiàn] is outside.

35
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,223
In a sentence [Wǒ de diànnǎo zài wàimiàn ne！], [zài] is a verb.

36
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:03,228
expressing existence in a location

37
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:08,916
similar to how we say in
English, 'to be at' or 'to be in'.

38
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:16,060
For example,

39
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,420
[FOREIGN].

40
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,580

00:03:55,747 --> 00:04:02,628
dialogue three.

48
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:07,414
Pay attention to the weather
in the two cities.

50

00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:29,452
The answer

54
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:36,222

[Hā ěr bīn de tiānqì zěnmeyànɡ？] 

56
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:46,753
[Yǒu diǎnr lěnɡ.] [Yǒu diǎnr lěnɡ.]

Usually indicating something unpleasant or
undesired.

The structure is [yǒu diǎnr] + adjective or

60
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:07,598
psychological verb.

61
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,463

An exercise for you.

Listen.

68
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,445
