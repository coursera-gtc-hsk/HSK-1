1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,304
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:13,569
[Tónɡxué men hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào
HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ. Nǐ yǒu ɡǒu mɑ？]

3
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:18,544
[Nǐ yǒu māo mɑ?]
[Nǐ de ɡǒu jiào shénme mínɡzi?]

4
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:24,809
[Nǐ de māo duōdà le?]
[Wǒ méiyǒu ɡǒu.]

5
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:30,002
[yě méiyǒu māo.]
Actually, when I was young,

6
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:35,315
[Wǒ yǒu ɡǒu，wǒ yě yǒu māo.]

7
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:40,260
Today we are going to read an
e-mail from Lucy to Jenny.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,268
Both Lucy and Jenny are learning
 Chinese now.

9
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:47,678
Listen to Lucy carefully.

10
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:52,013
Tell me what kind of
information you've got.

11
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:57,013
Jenny, [Nǐ hǎo]
[Wǒ zài běi jīng xué xí hàn yǔ ne!]

12
00:00:57,013 --> 00:01:04,856
[Wǒ men de xué xiào hěn dà]
[Wǒ de lǎo shī jiào wáng huān,]

13
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:13,856
[Tā jīn nián sān shí liù suì.]
[Wáng lǎo shī yǒu yī gè ér zi hé yī gè nǚ ér,]

14
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:22,556
[Tā ér zi wǔ suì, nǚ ér sān suì.]
[Nǐ zěn me yàng?] Lucy.

15
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,836
Lucy mentioned three
people in her email.

16
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:38,257
[Tāmen duōdà le?] One is [sān shí liù suì],

17
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:46,953
One is [wǔ suì], and the last one
is [sān suì].

18
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:53,154
Who are they then? A little
later you'll be clearer

19
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,355
about the content of the email.

20
00:01:57,772 --> 00:02:01,831
The first sentence from the email is

21
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:08,529
[wǒ zài běi jīng xué xí hàn yǔ ne!]

22
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,235
I'm learning Chinese in Beijing.

23
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:18,427
[Zài] followed by a location,

24
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:27,830
comes before a verb. It is to indicate the location
where an action or activity takes place.

25
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,940
This is one case that Chinese word
order is quite different from English.

26
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:48,728
The structure is subject + [zài] +
Place + Verb + Object

27
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:57,982
More examples,
[Gēge zài zhōngguó gōngzuò.]

28
00:02:57,982 --> 00:03:00,490
Elder brother works in China.

29
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:07,416
[Mèimei zài měiguó lǚxíng.]

30
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:11,751
Younger sister travels in America.

31
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:14,800
[Běijīnɡ] is the capital city of China.

32
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,775
[xuéxí] means to learn or to study.

33
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:24,960
[hànyǔ] is Chinese language.

34
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:32,970
We have learnt [ne] in [nǐ ne], but this
[ne] is very different.

35
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:40,671
In this sentence, [ne] is to indicate
that an action is ongoing or in progress.

36
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:48,292
For example, you could say

37
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:56,263
[Māma xiězì ne.]

38
00:03:56,263 --> 00:04:05,299
[Bàba dǎ diànhuà ne.]

39
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:12,343
And the structure is here. Okay?

40
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:14,941
Let's read the whole text.

41
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Jenny, [Nǐ hǎo]
[Wǒ zài běi jīng xué xí hàn yǔ ne!]

42
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:41,856
[Wǒ men de xué xiào hěn dà]
[Wǒ de lǎo shī jiào wáng huān,]

43
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:58,856
[Tā jīn nián sān shí liù suì.]
[Wáng lǎo shī yǒu yī gè ér zi hé yī gè nǚ ér,]

44
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:11,556
[Tā ér zi wǔ suì, nǚ ér sān suì.]
[nǐ zěn me yàng? ] Lucy.

45
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:21,191
Here are some more new words.
[xuéxiào] is school or university.

46
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:27,355
[ɡè] is the most commonly
used measure word in Chinese.

47
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:35,262
You can say [yí ɡè rén] [yí ɡè lǎoshī]
[yí ɡè diànhuà]

48
00:05:35,262 -->00:05:41,235
[érzi] is son, [nǚ'ér] is daughter,

49
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:44,459
[hé] means and.

50
00:04:45,459 --> 00:05:48,924
Read after me please.

51
00:05:48,924 --> 00:06:11,828
[xuéxiào][xuéxiào] [ɡè][ɡè]
[érzi][érzi] [hé][hé] [nǚ'ér][nǚ'ér]

52
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:19,139
Can you give me more examples
by using [hé] to connect two words.

53
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,604
I have got three, you may have more.

54
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:34,169
[bàba hé māma]

55
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:51,683
[lǎoshī hé tóngxué]
[māo hé gǒu]

56
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:55,530
Let's do an exercise.

57
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:01,556
Which two words are related
to your family?

58
00:07:01,556 --> 00:07:06,308
Which two words are related to education?

59
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:10,422
Which two words are places?

60
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:11,826
Let's have a look.

61
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:20,832
[běijīng] [xuéxiào]

62
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:26,699
Place.

63
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:35,543
[érzi] [nǚ'ér] Family

64
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:41,681
[xuéxiào] [xuéxí]

65
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:43,723
Education.

66
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,312
That's all for today.

67
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:51,750
Looking forward to seeing you next time.

68
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,990
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
