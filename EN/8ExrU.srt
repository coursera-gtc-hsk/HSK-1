00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,620
Hello, welcome to Chinese for HSK.

2
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,850
My name is YU Bin.

3
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,360
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:29,970
Wo jiao YU Bin. For the first week of your Chinese study,

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,765
we'll talk about greetings and numbers.

6
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:37,850
In this lesson, we're going to learn how to greet

7
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:43,030
people and how to ask somebody's name in Chinese.

8
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,195
Firstly, let's watch a short video and

9
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:51,605
see what people say when they meet for the first time.

10
00:00:51,605 --> 00:01:11,250
Here come Xudong and Tingna.

11
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:11,251
Ni hao.

12
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:11,252
Ni hao.

13
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:11,253
Ni jiao shenme mingzi?

14
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:11,254
Wo jiao tigna

15
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:11,255
Ni jiao shenme mingzi?

16
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:11,256
Wo jiao Xudong.

17
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:11,257
Hen gaoxing renshi ni.

18
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:11,258
Hen gaoxing renshi ni.

19
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:12,915
Cannot understand much?

20
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:18,025
Don't worry. I'm sure you'll be okay at the end of this lesson.

21
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:22,520
You may have known that's the most commonly used phrase for

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,950
greetings in Chinese is ni hao, hello.

23
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,445
Ni means you, hao means good.

24
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:36,485
So, ni hao literally means you good.

25
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:42,485
However, ni hao is rarely used among very close friends or families.

26
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:49,305
Ni and hao about third tone when two-third tones are read in sequence,

27
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:53,045
the first syllable turns into the second term.

28
00:01:53,045 --> 00:02:00,180
So, ni hao it's read ni hao rather than ni hao.

29
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,545
Although, you need to mark it at third tone in writing.

30
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:13,030
Follow me please, ni hao, ni hao.

31
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,270
One day, we may meet up somewhere in the world.

32
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,450
How do you greet me?

33
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,115
You may say, ni hao!

34
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:27,450
Yu laoshi!

35
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,590
I say to you, for example,

36
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:41,010
ni hao Jenny, ni hao Lucy, ni hao David.

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:51,075
To ask somebody's name in Chinese is ni jiao shenme mingzi?

38
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:54,540
Literally, your quote what name,

39
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,655
jiao means to call,

40
00:02:56,655 --> 00:03:00,945
shenme is what, mingzi is name.

41
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:07,245
To respond, you say wo jiao followed by your name.

42
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:10,095
Unlike English, the question word,

43
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:15,580
shenme is usually placed after the verb in the sentence.

44
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,199
Sometimes, a noun such as a person,

45
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,245
a book, or name follows it.

46
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:28,425
Now, read with me jiao, jiao,

47
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:37,695
shenma, shenme, mingzi, mingzi, wo, wo.

48
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:46,466
Ni jiao shenme mingzi?

49
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:55,930
Wo jiao, wo jiao. Let's do an exercise now.

50
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,630
Match the Chinese words with pictures or English words.

51
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,760
Let's say it together.

52
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,450
Ni hao. Which one? Yeah, here.

53
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:22,420
Mingzi, jiao,

54
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,700
this one, shenme.

55
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:36,430
Did you get it? One more sentence

56
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,470
for you is hen gaoxing renshi ni, nice to meet you.

57
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,650
Literally, it means very happy to know you.

58
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,320
Read after me, please.

59
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:57,705
Hen, hen, gaoxing, gaoxing, renshi,

60
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:03,825
renshi, hen gaoxing renshi ni,

61
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:08,380
hen gaoxing renshi mi.

62
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,250
Reads the text of the video with me, please.

63
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,760
Ni hao!

64
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,800
Ni hao!

65
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,145
Ni jiao shenme mingzi?

66
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:26,820
Wo jiao tingna.

67
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,090
Ni jiao shenme mingzi.

68
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,600
Wo jiao Xudong.

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,115
Hen gaoxing renshi ni.

70
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:42,820
Han gaoxing renshi ni.

71
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,515
Now, listen to a conversation between two people,

72
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,360
two questions for you.

73
00:05:50,360 --> 00:06:10,740
Ni hao. Wo jiao Bide.

74
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:10,741
Hen gaoxing renshi ni.

75
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:14,320
Okay? Let's see the answers.

76
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:23,850
The man's name, Bide,

77
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:30,120
Bide, and the woman's name,

78
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,320

00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:42,010
