(Nǐ hǎo.
Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.)


1
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,620
[Nǐ hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]
Hello, welcome to Chinese for HSK.

2
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,850
My name is YU Bin.

3
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,360
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:29,970
[Wǒ jiào Yú Bīn. Hěn ɡāoxìnɡ rènshi nǐ.]
For the first week of your Chinese study,

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,765
we'll talk about greetings and numbers.

6
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:37,850
In this lesson, we're going to learn how to greet

7
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:43,030
people and how to ask somebody's name in Chinese.

8
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,195
Firstly, let's watch a short video and see

9
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:51,605
what people say when they meet for the first time.

10
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:59,250
Here come Xudong and Tingna.

11
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,251
>> [Nǐ hǎo!] >> [Nǐ hǎo!]

12
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:05,000
>> [Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?]
>> [Wǒ jiào Tínɡnà. Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?]

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,800
>> [Wǒ jiào Xùdōnɡ. Hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ.]
>> [Hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ.]

14
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:12,915
Cannot understand much? Don't worry.

15
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:18,025
I'm sure you'll be okay at the end of this lesson.

16
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:22,520
You may have known that's the most
commonly used phrase for

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,950
greetings in Chinese is [nǐ hǎo], hello.

18
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,445
[Nǐ] means you, [hǎo] means good.

19
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:36,485
So, [nǐ hǎo] literally means you good.

20
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:42,485
However, [Nǐ hǎo] is rarely used among
very close friends or families.

21
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:49,305
[Nǐ] and [hǎo] are both third tones.
When two-third tones are read in sequence,

22
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:53,045
the first syllable turns into the second tone.

23
00:01:53,045 --> 00:02:00,180
So, nǐ hǎo it's read ní hǎo rather than nǐ hǎo.

24
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,545
Although, you need to mark it at third tone in writing.

25
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:13,030
Follow me please, [ní hǎo], [ní hǎo].

26
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,270
One day, we may meet up somewhere in the world.

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,450
How do you greets me?

28
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:27,115
You may say, [ní hǎo! Yú lǎoshī!]

29
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,590
And I could say to you, for example,

30
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:41,010
[Ní hǎo Jenny, ní hǎo Lucy, ní hǎo David.]

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:51,075
To ask somebody's name in Chinese is
[Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?]

32
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:54,540
Literally, you call what name,

33
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,655
[jiào] means to call,

34
00:02:56,655 --> 00:03:00,945
[shénme] is what, [míngzi] is name.

35
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:07,245
To respond, you say [wǒ jiào] followed by your name.

36
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:10,095
Unlike English, the question word,

37
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:15,580
[shénme] is usually placed after the verb
in the sentence.

38
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,199
Sometimes, a noun such as a person,

39
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,245
a book, or name follows it.

40
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:28,425
Now, read with me: [jiào], [jiào],

41
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:37,695
[shénme], [shénme], [míngzi], [míngzi], [wǒ], [wǒ].

42
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:46,466
[Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?]
[Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?]

43
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:55,930
[Wǒ jiào], [wǒ jiào].
Let's do an exercise now.

44
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,630
Match the Chinese words with pictures or English words.

45
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,760
Let's do it together.

46
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,450
[Ní hǎo]. Which one? Yeah, here.

47
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:22,420
[Míngzi], [jiào],

48
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:29,700
this one, [shénme].

49
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,430
Did you get it? One more sentence

50
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,470
for you is [Hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ.], nice to meet you.

51
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,650
Literally, it means very happy to know you.

52
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,320
Read after me, please.

53
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:57,705
[Hěn], [Hěn], [gāoxìng], [gāoxìng], [rènshi],

54
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:03,825
[rènshi], [Hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ.]

55
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:08,380
[Hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ.]

56
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,250
Read the text of the video with me, please.

57
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,760
[Nǐ hǎo!]

58
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,800
[Nǐ hǎo!]

59
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,145
[Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?]

60
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:30,090
[Wǒ jiào Tínɡnà. Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?]

61
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,600
[Wǒ jiào Xùdōnɡ.]

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,115
[Hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ.]

63
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:42,820
[Hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ.]

64
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,515
Now, listen to a conversation between two people,

65
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,360
two questions for you.

66
00:05:50,360 --> 00:06:10,741
[Nǐ hǎo, wǒ jiào  Bǐdé. Hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ.]
[Nǐ hǎo, wǒ jiào  Mǎlì. Hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ.]

67
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:14,320
Okay? Let's see the answers.

68
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:23,850
The man's name, [Bǐdé],

69
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:30,120
[Bǐdé], and the woman's name,

70
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,320
[Mǎlì], [Mǎlì].

71
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:42,010
Are you correct? That's all for today.

72
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,635
I hope you enjoyed the lesson. Thank you.

73
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:50,640
Bye bye. [Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
