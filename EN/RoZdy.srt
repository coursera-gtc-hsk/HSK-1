we're going to

5
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:26,653
learn how to ask about

6
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:34,640
nationality in Chinese.

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:44,415
Where are you from or
what's your nationality is [FOREIGN].

8
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:48,317
In Chinese, [FOREIGN] is to be,

9
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:53,870
[FOREIGN] is which,
[FOREIGN] means country,

10
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,980
a nation, [FOREIGN] is person or people.

11
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:06,876
Word by word is you
are which country person?

12
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:14,242
Read after me please [FOREIGN].

13
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:20,861
That's word order in sentence

14
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:25,444
weird, not really,

15
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:31,307
it's the same as [FOREIGN].

16
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:38,260
A subject, a verb,
question word, and a noun.

17
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,266
If you ask me [FOREIGN].

18
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:49,472
I'll tell you [FOREIGN] I'm Chinese.

19
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:56,469
[FOREIGN] It's China, so
to talk about nationality in Chinese,

20
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:02,049
you just add [FOREIGN] after
the name of the country.

21
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:08,661
For example American is [FOREIGN],

22
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:12,998
Japanese is [FOREIGN].

23
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:20,230
Please pay attention to [FOREIGN],
Chinese verbs do not have inflections.

24
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:27,241
That is the form of the verb it's
the same no matter what the subject is.

25
00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:33,360
For example,

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,874
in the sentences,

27
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:44,082
[FOREIGN] the verb is always

28
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:50,017
[FOREIGN] never changes.

29
00:02:50,017 --> 00:02:56,625

00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:03,967

35
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:30,105

00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:47,745
>> [FOREIGN]

40
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:54,886
>> An exercise for you.

41
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:01,268
Match the people in the video
with their nationalities.

42
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:16,127
Okay, [FOREIGN]

43
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:22,571
and the girl

44
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:29,665
with the book

45
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:37,111
[FOREIGN] are you correct?

46
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:46,833
The last dialogue in the video

47
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,963
is a question [FOREIGN].

48
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:55,665
[FOREIGN]
means

49
00:04:55,665 --> 00:05:00,366
she, [FOREIGN]

50
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:04,682
means also.

51
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:07,966
The question is, where is she from?

52
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:11,968
[FOREIGN].

53
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:13,707
She is also Chinese.

54
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:20,755
Different from English, yeah,
it's placed before verb.

55
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:25,620
You can't put

56
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,891
it after verb or

57
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:39,405
at the end of a sentence,

58
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:44,676
moreover if you

59
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:48,731
say [FOREIGN]

60
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:56,435
you can't say [FOREIGN]

61
00:05:56,435 --> 00:06:00,490
but [FOREIGN]

62
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,545

63
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:10,235
