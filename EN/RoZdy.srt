00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,357
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:17,089
[Nǐ hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]
Hello, welcome to HSK Chinese.

3
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:22,369
[Wǒ jiào Yú Bīn. Hěn ɡāoxìnɡ rènshi nǐ.]
I am YU Bin, nice to meet you.

4
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:28,653
[Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi, nǐ shì nǎ guó rén?]
What's your name, what's your nationality?

5
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:34,640
Today we are going to learn how to ask about
nationality in Chinese.

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:44,415
Where are you from or what's your nationality
is [nǐ shì nǎ guó rén?].

7
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:51,317
In Chinese, [shì] is to be, [nǎ] is which,

8
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:59,870
[guó] means country or nation, [rén] is
person or people.

9
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:06,876
Word by word is: you, are, which, country,
person.

10
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:19,242
Read after me please, [nǐ shì nǎ guó rén?]

11
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:24,400
Is the word order in sentence weird?
Not really.

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,658
it's the same as [Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi].

13
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:36,290
A subject, a verb,
question word, and a noun.

14
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,259
If you ask me, [Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuórén?]

15
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:50,167
I'll tell you [Wǒ shì Zhōnɡɡuórén.]
I'm Chinese.

16
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:56,469
[Zhōnɡɡuó] is China, so to talk about
nationality in Chinese,

17
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:02,049
you just add [rén] after
the name of the country.

18
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,643
For example American is [Měiɡuórén],

19
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:13,237
Japanese is [Rìběnrén].

20
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:20,230
Please pay attention to [shì],
Chinese verbs do not have deflections.

21
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:27,241
That is the form of the verb is the same
no matter what the subject is.

22
00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:33,360
For example, in the sentences,

23
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:42,774
[Wǒ shì Zhōnɡɡuó rén], [Nǐ shì Měiɡuó rén],
[Tā shì Yìdàlì rén],

24
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:50,017
the verb is always [shì] never changes.

25
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:52,805
Read after me please

26
00:02:52,805 --> 00:03:05,327
[Wǒ shì Zhōnɡɡuó rén] [Nǐ shì Měiɡuó rén]
[Tā shì Yìdàlì rén]

27
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:17,349
again? [Wǒ shì Zhōnɡɡuó rén] [Nǐ shì Měiɡuó rén]
[Tā shì Yìdàlì rén]

28
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,975
Let's watch a video now, listen to [Xùdōnɡ] and
[Kǎilì] carefully,

29
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:28,896
tell me where they're from.

30
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:31,675
>> [ní hǎo.] >> [ní hǎo.]

31
00:03:31,675--> 00:03:36,796
>>[Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuórén?]
>>[Wǒ shì Zhōnɡɡuó rén. Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuórén?]

32
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:50,545
>> [Wǒ shì Měiɡuó rén. Tā shì nǎ ɡuórén?]
>> [Tā yě shì Zhōnɡɡuó rén.]

33
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:54,886
An exercise for you.

34
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:01,480
Match the people in the video
with their nationalities.

35
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:18,127
Okay, [Xùdōnɡ shì nǎ ɡuórén?]
[Zhōnɡɡuó rén]

36
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:26,727
[Kǎilì shì Měiɡuó rén]

37
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:29,571
and the girl with the book

38
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:37,111
[yě shì Zhōnɡɡuó rén]
are you correct?

39
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:50,963
The last dialogue in the video
is a question, [Tā shì nǎ ɡuórén?]

40
00:04:50,963 --> 00:05:03,866
And the answer, [Tā yě shì Zhōnɡɡuó rén.]
[Tā] means she, [yě] means also.

41
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:07,966
The question is, where is she from?

42
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:13,968
And [Xùdōnɡ] says, She is also Chinese.

43
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:20,755
Different from English, [yě] is placed
before verb.

44
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:26,520
You can't put it after verb
or at the end of a sentence.

45
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,076
Moreover, if you say me too,

46
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:37,535
you can't say [wǒ yě],
but [wǒ yě shì].

47
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,808
Read with me again,

48
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:50,328
>> [Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuórén?]
>> [Wǒ shì Zhōnɡɡuó rén. ]

49
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:57,917
>> [Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuórén?]
>> [Wǒ shì Měiɡuó rén.]

50
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:07,437
>> [Tā shì nǎ ɡuórén?]
>> [Tā yě shì Zhōnɡɡuó rén.]

51
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:17,015
Okay, that's all for today,
don't forget your quiz for the lesson.

52
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:20,878
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
