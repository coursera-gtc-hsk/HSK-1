00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,374
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:11,687
[Tónɡxuémen hǎo! Huānyínɡ láidào
HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:15,946
[Jīntiān tiānqì zěnmeyànɡ？Jīntiān rè mɑ?]

4
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:21,625
[Jīntiān lěnɡ mɑ? Yǒu yǔ mɑ?]
Do you like the weather in your place?

5
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:26,837
[Jīntiān Běijīnɡ yǒu diǎnr rè.]

6
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:32,812
[Méiyǒu yǔ.] In this lesson,

7
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:38,590
we're going to listen and
read a postcard from Daxing to Xiaomei.

8
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,520
Daxing is working in Shanghai.

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,688
Let's see in Daxing's eyes
what it's like in Shanghai.

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,509
Firstly, let's learn some new words.

11
00:00:56,454 --> 00:01:07,074
[lái] [duō] [chē]

12
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:17,074
[zhèlǐ] [gōngzuò]

13
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:28,027
[de shíhou] [shànghǎi]

14
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:33,575
We've learnt [duō] in
[duō dà], which means how old.

15
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:38,806
But the basic meaning of
[duō] is many, a lot.

16
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:42,450
Many people, [hěn duō rén].

17
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,100
Many schools, is [hěn duō xué xiào].

18
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,462
A lot of rain, [hěn duō yǔ].

19
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:58,346
To talk about events that happened at or

20
00:01:58,346 --> 00:02:04,019
during a particular time,
[de shíhou] is often used.

21
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,204
For example,

22
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:16,760
[Zuótiān nǐ dǎ diànhuà de shíhou, wǒ bù zài jiā.]

23
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:26,319
[Zhōngwǔ chīfàn de shí hou, wǒ gēgē lái le.]

24
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,778
That's the structure, we can have a look.

25
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:35,978
Now we are going to listen to Daxing.

26
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:41,675
Please pay attention to the size,

27
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:45,015
the people, cars,scenery and the weather.

28
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:49,340
[Xiǎoměi, wǒ lái shànghǎi wǔ gè yuè le.
shànghǎi hěn dà, ]

29
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:59,340
[rén duō, chē duō, yě hěn piàoliàng.]
[Xiànzài shànghǎi tiānqì hěn hǎo, bù lěng bù rè.]

30
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:14,819
[wǒ qù gōngzuò de shíhou rènshi le hěnduō péngyǒu,
nǐ shénme shíhou lái shànghǎi? Dàxīng, 2016.03.25]

31
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:21,672
Let's see the answers.
What is Shanghai like?

32
00:03:21,672 --> 00:03:25,705
The size? [hěn dà.]

33
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:32,080
People? [rén duō.]

34
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,124
Cars? [chē duō.]

35
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:44,262
Scenery, [piàoliàng.]

36
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:47,687
What about weather?

37
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:51,342
[bù lěng bù rè.]

38
00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:57,084
[Nǐ dá duì le mɑ？] If not,
don't worry.

39
00:03:57,084 --> 00:04:02,311
We'll read Daxing's postcard.

40
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:05,832
[Xiǎoměi, wǒ lái shànghǎi wǔ gè yuè le.
shànghǎi hěn dà, rén duō,]

41
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:13,880
[Xiǎoměi, wǒ lái shànghǎi wǔ gè yuè le.
shànghǎi hěn dà, rén duō,]

42
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,910
[chē duō, yě hěn piàoliàng.]

43
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,940
[Xiànzài shànghǎi tiānqì hěn hǎo,

44
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:30,479

 hěnduō péngyǒu,nǐ shénme shíhou lái shànghǎi?]

46
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:46,557
Dàxīng, 2016.03.25]

47
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:50,599
In your language, perhaps you don't have

48
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:58,151
something like a sentence with
an adjectival predicate, but we do in Chinese.

49
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:06,300
Usually, the structure is -
Please have a look.

50
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,115
It's a bit complicated, isn't it?

51
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:16,698
Okay, let's see the examples.

52
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:19,366
Follow me, please.

53
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:23,769
[Shànghǎi hěn dà.]

54
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:30,847
[Tiān qì bù rè.]
How do you say,

55
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:37,899
'My younger brother is cool" and
"His dog is not pretty"?

56
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:46,168
[wǒ dìdi hěn kù!]

57
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:53,906
[Tā de gǒu bù piàoliàng.]

58
00:05:56,098 --> 00:06:03,538
There are also sentences like
[shànghǎi tiānqì hěn hǎo.]

59
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:06,797
Their structure is,

60
00:06:06,797 --> 00:06:15,714
have a look please.

61
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:22,399
Okay, follow me to read the examples.

62
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,871
[Zhèlǐ tiānqì hěnrè. ]

63
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:32,319
[Zhèlǐ tiānqì hěnrè. ]

64
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,783
[Nàlǐ fēngjǐng hěn piàoliàng.]

65
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:41,743
[Nàlǐ fēngjǐng hěn piàoliàng.]

66
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:51,170
From the text, can you get
the answers to the questions below?

67
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:06,865
Number one, how long has Daxing
 been in Shanghai?

68
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,125
Has he got any friends there?

69
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,318
When did he get to know them?

70
00:07:16,318 --> 00:07:19,191
What is the date of Daxing's postcard?

71
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:31,020
Okay, please give the answers by yourself.

72
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,031
That's all for today.

73
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:35,780
Hope you enjoyed the lesson.

74
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,560
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
