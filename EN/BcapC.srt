1
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:12,932
[Tónɡxuémen hǎo! Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

2
00:00:12,932 --> 00:00:22,066
[Nǐ xiǎnɡ qù Shànɡhǎi mɑ? Nǐ xiǎnɡ lái Běijīnɡ mɑ?
 Shànɡhǎi dà mɑ? Běijīnɡ rén duō mɑ?]

3
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:27,878
Wǒ yǒu hěn duō Zhōnɡɡuó pénɡyou,
yě yǒu hěn duō wàiɡuó pénɡyou.]

4
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:34,525
[Nǐ ne?] We're going to watch a video.

5
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,069
Before we do, we will learn some new words.

6
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:44,285
Read with me please.

7
00:00:44,285 --> 00:01:27,248
[shàngeèyuè] [qián] [nǎr]  [xǐhuan] [hǎochī]
[dōu] [bīngmǎyǒng] [xī'ān] [xiānggǎng]

8
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:30,710
[qián] is before or ago.

9
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,770
When you use [qián], the order
is different from English.

10
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:40,700
For example, before going to Xi'an,

11
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:49,750
[qù Xī’ān qián]. Before having dinner,

12
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,599
[chīfàn qián]. A month ago,

13
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,714
[yí ɡe yuè qián].

14
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:05,061
[nǎr] means where.

15
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:08,478
As other wh- words,

16
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:12,508
the structure of [nǎr] is

17
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:20,554
subject plus verb plus [nǎlǐ] or [nǎr],

18
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:23,107
the same meaning.

19
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:26,264
For example, [Nǐ qù nǎr?]

20
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:31,791
 [Wǒ qù Xiānɡɡǎnɡ.]

21
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,430
Video time now.

22
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,194
Listen to the conversation
between Xudong and Xiaobei, and

23
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,920
thinking about the questions below.

24
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,252
>> [Xiǎobèi, zhè shì nǎr?]

28
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,448

29
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:08,450
>> [Xiāng gǎng ne?]
>> [Xiānggǎng de fàn hěn hǎochī.]

30
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,317

32
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,388
>> [Xī'ān hé xiānggǎng de tiānqì dōu hěn rè.]

33
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:27,299
Okay, number one.

34
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,915
[Shànɡ ɡè yuè shéi qù le Xī'ān?]

35
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:37,694
[Xiǎobèi.]

36
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:50,478
[Qù Xī'ān qián tā qù nǎr le?] [Xiānɡɡǎnɡ.]

37
00:03:50,478 --> 00:03:58,947
[Tā xǐhuɑn Xī'ān de shénme?]
[Bīnɡmǎyǒnɡ.]

38
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,094
What did she mention about Hong Kong?

39
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:11,201
Number four, [Fàn, Xiānɡɡǎnɡ de fàn.]

40
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:19,308
[Xī'ān hé Xiānɡɡǎnɡ de tiānqì zěnmeyànɡ?]

41
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:22,269
[Dōu hěn rè.]

42
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:30,210
If you don't understand well about
their conversation, don't worry.

43
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,295

51
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:44,290
That's all for today.
