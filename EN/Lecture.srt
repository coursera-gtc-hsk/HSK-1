00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,560
[inaudible]

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,860
Can you tell me your country's name in Chinese?

3
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,630
Yingguo? Hanguo? Aiji? Aodaliya?

4
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,890
In this lesson, we're going to learn how to count numbers

5
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,915
and talk about people's ages in Chinese.

6
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:49,560
Follow me to read 1 to 10 please.

7
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:59,430
Yi, yi,

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,430

00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,430

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,930
jiu, jiu,

16
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:43,035
shi, shi.

17
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:47,470
On top, the number is

18
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,770
ling, ling.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,940
Wow, so many pandas.

20
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,190
[inaudible]

21
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,095
Let's read it.

22
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:09,950
Yi, yi,

23
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,630

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,630

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,130
wu, wu,

27
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,630
liu, liu,

28
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,130
qi, qi,

29
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,630
ba, ba,

30
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,130
jiu, jiu.

31
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,600
The last picture,

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,020
shi, shi.

33
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,199
Numbers above 10 are easy to remember,

34
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:11,640
you just say ten one, ten two, et cetera.

35
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,590
Shi yi, shi er.

36
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,790
Let's see some more numbers.

37
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,620
Read the list with me, please.

38
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,840
Shi yi

39
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Shi er

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,840
er shi

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,340
er shi san

42
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,840
san shi si

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,340
si shi qi

44
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,340
wu shi liu

45
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,840
liu shi jiu

46
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,575
qi shi ba,

47
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:01,950
ba shi wu,

48
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,250
jiu shi jiu.

49
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,540
How do you ask someone's age in Chinese?

50
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,030
Here is a video for you.

51
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:31,950
[inaudible]

52
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,710
Did you hear the age of these three people?

53
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,320
er shi si

54
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,850
er shi yi

55
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,760
shi ba

56
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,795
ni duo da le?

57
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:59,430
How old are you?

58
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,650
Ni duo means how old.

59
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:12,110
Le is used at the end of a sentence to indicate change of state.

60
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:20,905
In other words, there's now a new situation or there is about to be a new situation.

61
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:24,445
Si means year.

62
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:27,085
For the answer to the question,

63
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:29,425
ni duo da le,

64
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:36,160
you say, Wo, plus your age and then say,

65
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,020
read after me please.

66
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,445
Ni duo da le?

67
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:49,460
Ni duo da le?

68
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,525
Wo er shi si sui.

69
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:56,615
Wo er shi si sui.

70
00:05:56,615 --> 00:06:00,700
Ni ne?

71
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,105
Wo er shi yi sui.

72
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:08,870
Wo er shi yi sui.

73
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,400
Ta duo da le?

74
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,425
Ta duo da le?

75
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:20,700
Ta shi ba sui.

76
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,230
Ta shi ba sui.

77
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:32,280
Have you noticed there is a ne after after ni? What is it?

78
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,200
Ne is a participle which can be used to ask reciprocal questions,

79
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,920
also known as bounce-back questions.

80
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:54,450
Ne can be used to form simple questions asking what about or how about.

81
00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:00,945
The structure is, topic plus ne.

82
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:02,850
For example,

83
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,690
Ni duo da le?

84
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,170
Wo shi liu sui. Ni ne?

85
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,480
Wo er shi qi sui.

86
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,730
Ni shi na guo ren?

87
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,800
Wo shi Zhongguo ren.

88
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,240
Ni ne? We have

89
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,790
learned ni, wo, ta.

90
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:43,935
Interestingly, the pronunciation for he is the same as for she.

91
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:46,590
So, when I say ta,

92
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:52,150
you actually don't know if I'm talking about him or her.

93
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,910
That is really tricky, isn't it?

94
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:05,835
However, in writing we don't have this problem because they are different characters.

95
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:14,020
Have a look, ta, ta.

96
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,660
Now, let's do an exercise.

97
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,560
Listen to three statements.

98
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,300
The question is how old are they?

99
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:55,870
Number one. [inaudible]

100
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:15,510
Number two. [inaudible]

101
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:36,720
Number three. [inaudible]

102
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:46,020
Okay. Can you tell me [inaudible]?

103
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,330
Okay, let's see the answer,

104
00:09:51,110 --> 00:10:03,100
Obama [inaudible] Obama, wu shi si qui.

105
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:15,400
Zhang Ziyi, [inaudible] san shi qi sui.

106
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,730
The last person,

107
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:29,700
Lin Shuhao  [inaudible] er shi ba sui.

108
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,560
Did you get it?

109
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,880
We have learned so much today.

110
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,865
Have a good rest.

111
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:39,870
Xiexie!

112
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,520
Zaijian!
