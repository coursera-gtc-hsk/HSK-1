00:00:21,548 --> 00:00:25,240
Today, we're going to
talk about daily routine.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,710
There are two dialogues for you.

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,493
Before listening to dialogue one,
let's go over the new words.

00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:34,863
Follow me please.

00:00:34,863 --> 00:00:38,371

[jǐ] is a quantity question word for asking things like how many.

14
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,656
You need to use [jǐ] and
measure words together.

15
00:01:07,656 --> 00:01:11,810
You could say [jǐ ɡe rén].

16
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,849
How many people?

17
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:15,243
[jǐ zhī māo].

18
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,398

00:01:16,398 --> 00:01:18,842
And so on.

20
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:22,941
[diǎn] and [fēn] are used to
express time in Chinese.

21
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:25,214

In Chinese, we say bigger unit first and
then the smaller one.

00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:38,595
For example, [wǔ diǎn shí fēn] 

25
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:43,551
[yī diǎn èr shí wǔ fēn]

This is one of its uses.

28
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:57,024

00:01:57,024 --> 00:02:02,560

00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:19,503
We use it a lot in daily life.

34
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:25,118
Now listen to a dialogue and
then answer the questions.

35

46
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:30,014
[shénme shíhou] is a question word which means

00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:32,318
when or what time.

48
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,175
The structure is subject plus

49
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:41,454

00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:51,304
