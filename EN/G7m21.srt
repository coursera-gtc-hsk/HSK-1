00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,868
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,868 --> 00:00:10,871
[Nǐ hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:19,447
[Jīntiān shì jǐ yuè jǐ hào？Jīntiān xīnɡqī jǐ？Xiànzài jǐ diǎn le？] 

4
00:00:19,447 --> 00:00:25,165
[Shànɡ ɡè yuè nǐ qù nǎr le？] [Nàlǐ tiānqì zěnmeyànɡ？]

5
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:31,430
We learnt time and weather last week.

6
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,450
In this week, we're going to
talk about work and hobbies.

7
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,012
Let's start from lesson one.

8
00:00:40,012 --> 00:00:45,242
[FOREIGN]

9
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:50,476
Look at two pictures.

10
00:00:50,476 --> 00:01:00,476
[zhōnɡxué，zhōnɡxué] [Tónɡxuémen zài xuéxiào.]
[yínhánɡ，yínhánɡ] [Tāmen zài yínhánɡ ɡōnɡzuò.] 

11
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:13,969
[FOREIGN]

12
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:24,410
[FOREIGN]

13
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:34,410
[FOREIGN] [mínɡnián] is next year.

14
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:47,627
[Wǒmen yě xuéxí le] 'this year'. This year is [jīn nián]

15
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:51,289
[wàiɡuó rén] is foreigner.

16
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:55,233
[wàiɡuó] Foreign country.

17
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:59,055
[[Wǒmen yě xuéxí le]] 'Chinese people'.

18
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:03,873
[Zhōnɡɡuórén]. [Wǒ shì Zhōnɡɡuórén.]

19
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:09,381
[zuò] is to do. 

20
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:12,854
To cook, [zuò fàn ]. 

21
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:17,244
To do homework, [zuò zuōyè]. 

22
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:21,888
To do a job, [Zěnme shuō]? [zuò ɡōnɡzuò.]

23
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:27,405
[xuéshenɡ] student, university student? 

24
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:31,453
[dàxué shēnɡ]. Secondary school student?

25
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:36,656
[zhōnɡxué shēnɡ]. What about
primary school student?

26
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,759
[xiǎoxué shēnɡ]. [shǎo] is less,

27
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,865
little, or few.

28
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:49,062
[zěnme shuō] 'very few, very little'?

29
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:54,025
[hěn shǎo]. [zěnme shuō] quite a few?

30
00:02:54,025 --> 00:03:00,452
[bù shǎo]. What about not many, not few?

31
00:03:00,452 --> 00:03:06,532
It's [bù duō bù shǎo]. 

32
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:13,300
[ò] is to express exclamation of various kinds of emotional response.

33
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,531
It could be second tone as well
when a question follows.

34
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:26,938
Video time,
listen to Xiaobei and Tingna.

35
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:28,848
Two questions for you.

36
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:34,804
>> [FOREIGN]
>> [FOREIGN]

37
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:36,979
>> [FOREIGN]

38
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:41,600
>> [FOREIGN]

39
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,009
>> [FOREIGN]

40
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:47,606
>> [FOREIGN]

41
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:50,034
>> [FOREIGN]

42
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:56,804
>> [FOREIGN]

43
00:03:56,804 --> 00:04:02,633
>> Okay, let's see the answers.

44
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:06,179
Number one.

45
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:11,315
[FOREIGN]

46
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:16,451
[FOREIGN]

47
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:22,101
[FOREIGN]

48
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:28,776
[FOREIGN]

49
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:34,432
How do you ask me if you don't know what I do or where I work?

50
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:41,173
You may say [FOREIGN]

51
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:45,808
or [FOREIGN].

52
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:54,186
Literally [FOREIGN] you do what work?

53
00:04:54,186 --> 00:05:00,084
[FOREIGN] You ask where work.

54
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,337
For the answer,

55
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:17,404
I could say [FOREIGN]

56
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:22,957
or [FOREIGN].

57
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:26,677
Now please follow me to
read the whole text.

58
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:40,088
[FOREIGN]

59
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:46,891
or

60
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:56,891
[FOREIGN]

61
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,694
or

62
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:13,694
[FOREIGN].

63
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,417
There are two verbs in the sentence.

64
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,349
[Nǐ mínɡnián qù Xiānɡɡǎnɡ ɡōnɡzuò.] one is [qù],

65
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:32,468
the other one is [ɡōnɡzuò],

66
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:37,210
The predicate of the sentence

67
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,144
with a serial verb construction
consists of two or

68
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:47,907
more verbs. The latter verb can
be the purpose of the former.

69
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,791
For example,

70
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:59,445
[FOREIGN]

71
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:06,177
[FOREIGN]

72
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,328
Could you please have a try to

73
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:15,780
answer the questions here?

74
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,460
Look at the picture first.

75
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,835
And based on the picture, there are questions.

76
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:31,012
Number one, [FOREIGN].

77
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:36,901
Number two, [FOREIGN].

78
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:42,881
Number three, [FOREIGN].

79
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:48,981
And number four,

80
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:52,643
[FOREIGN].

81
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:59,342
The last one, [FOREIGN].

82
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:04,036
So I think for the answers you could say

83
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:09,328
probably [Tā shì lǎoshī.], for the first question.

84
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:14,389
And the second

85
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,185
[Tā zài dàxué、zhōnɡxué or xiǎoxué ɡōnɡzuò],

86
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:23,246
I think should

87
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:27,895
be [dàxué]. [Tā zài dàxué ɡōnɡzuò].

88
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:31,559
And number three,

89
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:37,062
[Tā de xuéshenɡ duō mɑ？]
a lot? not many.

90
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:41,566
You could say [bù duō].

91
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:47,477
And next one, [FOREIGN],

92
00:08:47,477 --> 00:08:51,150
probably not.

93
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:58,063
So you could say [Bú shì. Yǒu Zhōnɡɡuórén，yě yǒu wàiɡuó rén.]

94
00:08:58,063 --> 00:09:04,983
or you could say [Tāmen dōu shì wàiɡuó rén.].

95
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:10,684
Okay, the last question, [FOREIGN].

96
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:14,413
Studying, studying what?

97
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:19,963
So you could say,

98
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:26,625
[Tāmen zài xuéxí.]
or [Tāmen zài xuéxí hàn yǔ.].

99
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,674
That's all for today, see you next time.

100
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:34,431
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
