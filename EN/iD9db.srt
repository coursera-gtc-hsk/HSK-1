00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:23,201
[Nǐ huì shuō hànyǔ ma?] [Nǐ huì xiě hànzì ma?]

00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:30,201
[Huì shuō hànyǔ, huì xiě hànzì hěn kù, duì bú duì?]

00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,485

The good news is

14
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:13,410
that we don't have many
new words in the conversation.

15
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,996

each question?

is Tingna's [péngyou].

19
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:55,058
Number 3, The animal they mentioned

Please don't worry if you got some
wrong answers, they talked very fast.

21
00:02:04,914 --> 00:02:08,595
Let's go through the text then.

22
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,324

A couple of new words for you,
[péngyou] is friend.

30
00:03:51,314 --> 00:04:00,055
[kàn] means to look,
to see, to watch or to read.

31
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:07,621
To read a book, [kàn shū] or [dú shū].
[diàn yǐng] is film.

[Nǐ dá duì le ma?]
Are you correct?

49
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:52,825
The question type of
the exercise we have just done

50
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:58,609
is the same as part of
the listening test HSK Level 1.
