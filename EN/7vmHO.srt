00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:42,305
Okay, let's do an exercise. Reading.

69
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:45,963
Look at the words and the pictures.

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:06,810
This question type is the same as part
one of level one HSK reading test.

There are five items in part one.

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,244
Each item provides a picture and
a word or phrase,

75
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:22,270
you need to judge whether or
not they are consistent with each other.
