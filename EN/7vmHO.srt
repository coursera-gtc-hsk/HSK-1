00:00:53,501 --> 00:01:03,501
[FOREIGN]

00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:15,373
[FOREIGN] 

10
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:20,637
[FOREIGN] 

11
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:30,637
[zuótiān] is yesterday.

12
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:43,182
Do you remember today and tomorrow?

13
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:46,857

00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:58,377
So [zuótiān], [jīntiān], [mínɡtiān]. 

16
00:01:58,377 --> 00:02:03,234
[kànjiàn]
means to catch sight of or to see.

17
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:11,865
We have learned [kàn] in [kàn diànshì] and [jiàn] in [zàijiàn]. 

18
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:17,387
How do you translate,
I saw a cat in your school?

19
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:22,520
You could say [Wǒ zài nǐ de xuéxiào kànjiàn yì zhī māo. ] 

20
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:30,323
I caught sights of your younger
brother in the hospital.

21
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:35,323
[Wǒ zài yīyuàn kànjiàn le nǐ dìdi.] 

22
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:40,947
[jiějie] elder sister. For family members,

00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:49,707
[dìdi, jiějie] 

25
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:51,624
[hé] [mèimei].

26
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:53,541

27
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,590
Cinema. 

28
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:00,887
[Tāmen zài diànyǐnɡyuàn kàn diànyǐnɡ.] 

29
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:06,252
[ǹg], like [ò], it expresses

30
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:12,324
exclamation of various kinds of emotional response.

31
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:17,807
You could hear a lot in daily life,
if you are in China.

32
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:22,935
For example,

33
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:26,783

00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,556
Now we are going to watch a video.

36
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:40,284

[Huānhuān de jiějie zài nǎr ɡōnɡzuò？]

00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:35,422

00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:58,124
[Tā xǐhuɑn tā de ɡōnɡzuò mɑ?] 

55
00:04:58,124 --> 00:05:02,631
[Tā hěn xǐhuɑn.] 

56
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:07,140
Number four.

57
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:15,562
[Huānhuān xiǎnɡ zài yīyuàn ɡōnɡzuò mɑ？] [Tā bù xiǎnɡ.]

58
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:19,730
The last one.

59
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:29,730
[Tā xiǎnɡ zài nǎr ɡōnɡzuò？] [Zài diànyǐnɡyuàn.]

60
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:34,951
Here is the whole text.

61
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:38,713
Read after me please.

62
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:48,713
[FOREIGN].

63
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:42,305
Okay, let's do an exercise. Reading:

64
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:45,963
Look at the words and the pictures.

65
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:48,055
True or false?

66
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,830
[FOREIGN] Are you correct?

67
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:06,810
This question type is the same as part
one of level one HSK reading test.

68
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,660
There are five items in part one.

69
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,244
Each item provides a picture and
a word or phrase,

70
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:22,270
you need to judge whether or
not they are consistent with each other.

71
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,910
That's all for today,
hope you enjoyed the lesson.

72
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,395
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
