1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,039
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:10,662
[Nǐ hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]  

3
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:15,320
[Wǒ jiào Yú Bīn. Wǒ shì Zhōngguórén.] 

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,978
[Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuó rén?] 

5
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:27,747
[Nǐ duō dà le?] We learned numbers in the last lesson.

6
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:31,416
Could you please read
some numbers with me?

7
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:42,609
[yī，wǔ，qī，shí]

8
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:50,498
[èr shí liù，sān shí sì] 

9
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:57,260
[wǔ shí èr，jiǔ shí bā] 

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:05,152
And, the area code of China

11
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:10,018
[bā liù]

12
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:16,407
And the area code of Beijing

13
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:21,933
[yī línɡ]. In this lesson,

14
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:26,460
we're going to talk
about telephone number.

15
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,255
Let's see the new words for today.

16
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:34,288
Read after me please.

17
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:43,288
[Nǐ de. Nǐ de. Wǒ de. Wǒ de.]

18
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:53,558
[Diànhuà. Diànhuà. Hàomǎ. Hàomǎ.]

19
00:01:56,068 --> 00:02:05,558
[Duōshao. Duōshao. Míngtiān. Míngtiān.]

20
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:09,048
[Gěi. Gěi.]

21
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:18,173
[Dǎdiànhuà. Dǎdiànhuà.] 

22
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:25,740
You know [nǐ] and [wǒ] on the list.

23
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,221
What about [de] here?

24
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:33,819
[de] is the most frequently
used character in Chinese.

25
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,210
It has different functions but

26
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,780
here [de] is used to mark possession.

27
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,793
One way to think about [de] is that

28
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:52,299
it works like apostrophe s in English.

29
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:56,145
So [wǒ de] means my/mine,

30
00:02:56,145 --> 00:03:01,920
[nǐ de] means your, yours.

31
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,578
How do you say his or her then?

32
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:13,905
Yes, [tā de].

33
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:19,905
The structure is here: noun,

34
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:26,910
or pronoun plus [de] plus noun.

35
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:33,019
[wǒ de diànhuà]
My phone.

36
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,703
[tā de māma]
His mother.

37
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:41,818
[māma de míngzi]

38
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:48,495
Mother's name.

39
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:53,366
[duōshao] is how much or how many.

40
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:58,915
It's used to ask about numbers,
prices etc.

41
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:02,337
For example, 

42
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:12,604
[Zhè ge duōshao qián?]
[Zhè ge duōshao qián?]

43
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:22,874
[Nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]
[Nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]

44
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:28,140
Okay, let's watch a video and
listen to Tingna and

45
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,801
Xudong's conversation
about telephone number.

46
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:38,102
>> [Tíngnà, nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]

47
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:44,743
>> [Wǒ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì liù èr qī wǔ sì yāo èr èr(6275 4122). Nǐ de ne?]

48
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:49,996
>> [Wǒ de shì liù èr qī liù qī yāo qī wǔ(6276 7175).]

49
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:53,393
>> [Hao, wǒ míngtiān geǐ nǐ dǎ diànhuà.]

50
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:57,897
What is Tingna's number? And what's Xudong's number?

51
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:07,434
[Tíngnà de diànhuà hàomǎ]

52
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:11,628
Read with me please. 

53
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:17,919
[liù èr qī wǔ sì yāo èr èr.]

54
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:26,307
[Xùdōng de diànhuà hàomǎ.]

55
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:35,744
[liù èr qī liù qī yāo qī wǔ.].

56
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:41,783
You may have noticed that Tingna and
Xudong didn't say [yī] but

57
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:46,065
they said [yāo] for
their telephone numbers.

58
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:49,553
Why?

59
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:54,929
In speaking, when you tell
numbers if there is [yī],

60
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:57,957
you could say [yāo] instead.

61
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:03,510
That is because the pronunciation of [yī(1)] and
[qī(7)] are quite similar.

62
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,745
So, to distinguish them,
you can change [yī] to [yāo].

63
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,301
For example,

64
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:18,747
emergency number

65
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:23,493
in China [yāo yāo línɡ (110)].

66
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:28,327
And in America,

67
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:31,439
[jiǔ yāo yāo (911)].

68
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:37,304
Okay, do you remember the last

69
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:42,404
sentence in the video,

70
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:51,081
It's [Wǒ míngtiān gěi nǐ dǎ diànhuà.]
I will give you a ring tomorrow.

71
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:55,725
The time word [míngtiān]
could be placed before or

72
00:06:55,725 --> 00:07:01,757
after subject, but
it can't go to the end of a sentence.

73
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:04,501
Read with me please.

74
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:12,458
[Wǒ míngtiān gěi nǐ dǎ diànhuà.]

75
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,414
again.

76
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:20,789
[Wǒ míngtiān gěi nǐ dǎ diànhuà.]

77
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:24,900
Let's read the text.

78
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:36,150
[Tíngnà, nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]

79
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:51,905
 [wǒ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì liù èr qī wǔ sì yāo èr èr(6275 4122).]

80
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,126
[Nǐ de ne?]

81
00:07:55,126 --> 00:08:06,592
[wǒ de shì liù èr qī liù qī yāo qī wǔ(6276 7175).]

82
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:16,592
[Hao, wǒ míngtiān geǐ nǐ dǎ diànhuà.]
That's all for today.

83
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,349
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
