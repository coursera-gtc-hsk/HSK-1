1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,039
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:10,662
[Nǐ hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:19,978
[Wǒ jiào Yú Bīn. Wǒ shì Zhōngguórén.]
[Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuó rén?]

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:27,747
[Nǐ duō dà le?]
We learned numbers in the last lesson.

5
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:31,416
Could you please read some numbers with me?

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:51,498
[yī，wǔ，qī，shí, èr shí liù，sān shí sì]

7
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:58,260
[wǔ shí èr，jiǔ shí bā]

8
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:10,018
And, the area code of China, [bā liù].

9
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:19,407
And the area code of Beijing, [yī línɡ].

10
00:01:19,407 --> 00:01:26,460
In this lesson, we're going to talk
about telephone number.

11
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,255
Let's see the new words for today.

12
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:34,288
Read after me please.

13
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:43,288
[Nǐ de] [Nǐ de] [Wǒ de] [Wǒ de]

14
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:53,558
[Diànhuà] [Diànhuà] [Hàomǎ] [Hàomǎ]

15
00:01:56,068 --> 00:02:05,558
[Duōshao] [Duōshao] [Míngtiān] [Míngtiān]

16
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:09,048
[Gěi] [Gěi]

17
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:18,173
[Dǎdiànhuà] [Dǎdiànhuà]

18
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:25,740
You know [nǐ] and [wǒ] on the list.

19
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,821
what about [de] here?

20
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:33,819
[de] is the most frequently used character
in Chinese.

21
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,210
It has different functions, but

22
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,780
here [de] is used to mark possession.

23
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,793
One way to think about [de] is that

24
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:52,299
it works like 's in English.

25
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:56,145
So [wǒ de] means my/mine,

26
00:02:56,145 --> 00:03:01,920
[nǐ de] means your, yours.

27
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,578
How do you say his or her then?

28
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:13,905
Yes, it's [tā de].

29
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:19,905
The structure is here: noun,

30
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:26,910
or pronoun plus [de] plus noun.

31
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:33,019
[wǒ de diànhuà], my phone.

32
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,703
[tā de māma], his mother.

33
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:48,495
[māma de míngzi], mother's name.

34
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:53,366
[duōshao] is how much or how many.

35
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:58,915
It's used to ask about numbers,
prices etc.

36
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:09,604
For example, [Zhè ge duōshao qián?]
[Zhè ge duōshao qián?]

37
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:22,874
[Nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]
[Nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]

38
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:26,640
Okay, let's watch a video and listen to

39
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,801
Tingna and Xudong's conversation
about telephone number.

40
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:38,102
[Tíngnà, nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]

41
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:44,743
[Wǒ de shì liùèrqīwǔ sìyāoèrèr (6275 4122).
Nǐ de ne?]

42
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:49,996
[Wǒ de shì liùèrqī liù qīyāoqīwǔ(6276 7175).]

43
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:53,393
[Hǎo, wǒ míngtiān geǐ nǐ dǎ diànhuà.]

44
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:58,897
What is Tingna's number?
And what's Xudong's number?

45
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:09,628
[Tíngnà de diànhuà hàomǎ]
Read with me please.

46
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:19,919
[liùèrqīwǔ sìyāoèrèr]

47
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,307
[Xùdōng de diànhuà hàomǎ.]

48
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:35,744
[liùèrqīliù qīyāoqīwǔ]

49
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:41,783
You may have noticed that Tingna and
Xudong didn't say [yī],

50
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:46,065
but they said [yāo] for
their telephone numbers.

51
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:49,553
Why?

52
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:54,929
In speaking, when you tell
numbers if there is [yī],

53
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:57,957
you could say [yāo] instead.

54
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:03,510
That is because the pronunciation of [yī(1)]
and [qī(7)] are quite similar.

55
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,745
So, to distinguish them,
you can change [yī] to [yāo].

56
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:23,493
For example, emergency number in China,
[yāo yāo línɡ].

57
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:31,439
And in America, [jiǔ yāo yāo (911)].

58
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:37,304
Okay, do you remember the last
sentence in the video,

59
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:49,404
It's [Wǒ míngtiān gěi nǐ dǎ diànhuà.]
I will give you a ring tomorrow.

60
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:56,725
The time word [míngtiān] could be placed
before or after subject,

61
00:06:56,725 --> 00:07:01,757
but it can't go to the end of a sentence.

62
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:04,501
Read with me please.

63
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:14,414
[Wǒ míngtiān gěi nǐ dǎ diànhuà.], again,

64
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:20,789
[Wǒ míngtiān gěi nǐ dǎ diànhuà.]

65
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:24,900
Let's read the text.

66
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:36,150
[Tíngnà, nǐ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì duōshao?]

67
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:54,126
[wǒ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì liùèrqīwǔ
sìyāoèrèr (6275 4122). Nǐ de ne?]

68
00:07:55,126 --> 00:08:06,592
[wǒ de shì liùèrqīliù qīyāoqīwǔ
(6276 7175).]

69
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:16,592
[Hao, wǒ míngtiān geǐ nǐ dǎ diànhuà.]
That's all for today.

70
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,349
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
