00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.047
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08.047 --> 00:00:12.161
Hello, welcome to HSK Chinese.

3
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:17.089
[Nǐ hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

4
00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:22.369
[Wǒ jiào Yú Bīn. Hěn ɡāoxìnɡ rènshi nǐ.] 

5
00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.945
[Nǐ jiào shénme mínɡzi？] 

6
00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:34.690
[Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuó rén?] Today we are going to learn how to ask about nationality in Chinese.

7
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.830
Where are you from or
what's your nationality, is [Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuó rén?].

8
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:52.315
In Chinese [shì] is to be,
[nǎ] is which.

9
00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:56.408
[ɡuó] means country or nation.

10
00:00:56.408 --> 00:00:59.950
[rén] is person or people.

11
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:07.049
Word by word is,
you are which country person.

12
00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.983
Read after me please.

13
00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:16.292
[FOREIGN] Does the word

14
00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:24.400
order in the sentence weird? Not really!

15
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.658
It's the same as [Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?] a subject,

16
00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:36.290
a verb, a question word, and a noun.

17
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.259
If you ask me [Nǐ shì nǎ ɡuórén?]

18
00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.610
I will tell you [Wǒ shì Zhōnɡɡuórén.]

19
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.167
I'm Chinese.

20
00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:54.363
[Zhōnɡɡuó] is China.

21
00:01:54.363 --> 00:02:02.773
So to talk about nationality in Chinese
you just add ren after the name of the country.

22
00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:07.643
For example, American is [Měiɡuórén].

23
00:02:07.643 --> 00:02:13.237
Japanese is [Rìběnrén].

24
00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:16.494
Please pay attention to [shì].

25
00:02:16.494 --> 00:02:21.425
Chinese verbs do not have inflections,

26
00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:26.210
that is, the form of the verb is the same,

27
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.991
no matter what the subject is.

28
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:33.688
For example,

29
00:02:33.688 --> 00:02:40.774
in the sentences, [FOREIGN]

30
00:02:40.774 --> 00:02:47.552
the verb is always [shì]

31
00:02:47.552 --> 00:02:51.873
never changes.

32
00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:56.305
Read after me please.

33
00:02:56.305 --> 00:03:03.327
[FOREIGN]

34
00:03:03.327 --> 00:03:10.349
again,

35
00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:19.379
[FOREIGN].

36
00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.975
Let's watch a video now.

37
00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:26.896
Listen to [Xùdōnɡ ] and
[Kǎilì] carefully.

38
00:03:26.896 --> 00:03:30.375
Tell me where they are from.

39
00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:33.857
>> [FOREIGN]
>> [FOREIGN]

40
00:03:33.857 --> 00:03:35.545
>> [FOREIGN]

41
00:03:35.545 --> 00:03:37.508
>> [FOREIGN]

42
00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:44.584
>> [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN]

43
00:03:47.842 --> 00:03:50.066
>> [FOREIGN]

44
00:03:53.437 --> 00:03:58.005
>> An exercise for you.

45
00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:01.480
Match the people in the video
with their nationalities.

46
00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:09.330
Okay?

47
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.762
[FOREIGN]

48
00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.664
[FOREIGN]

49
00:04:20.664 --> 00:04:25.785
And the girl

50
00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:32.443
with the book,

51
00:04:32.443 --> 00:04:37.058
[FOREIGN].

52
00:04:37.058 --> 00:04:37.839
Are you correct?

53
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:47.711
The last dialog in the video

54
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:53.931
is, the question [FOREIGN] and

55
00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:59.345
the answer, [FOREIGN].

56
00:04:59.345 --> 00:05:01.524
[tā] means she.

57
00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:04.775
[yě] means also.

58
00:05:04.775 --> 00:05:09.470
The question is, where is she from?

59
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.973
And Xudong said, she is also Chinese.

60
00:05:14.973 --> 00:05:17.245
Different from English,

61
00:05:17.245 --> 00:05:21.029
[yě] is placed before a verb.

62
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:27.419
You can't put it after a verb or
at the end of a sentence.

63
00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.788
Moreover, if you say [Me too.]

64
00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:36.989
You can't say [wǒ yě] but [wǒ yě shì].

65
00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.808
Read with me again.

66
00:05:43.808 --> 00:05:50.328
[FOREIGN]

67
00:05:50.328 --> 00:05:55.917
[FOREIGN] 

68
00:05:55.917 --> 00:06:02.437
[FOREIGN] 

69
00:06:02.437 --> 00:06:08.025
[FOREIGN] 

70
00:06:08.025 --> 00:06:14.549
Okay, that's all for today.

71
00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:17.519
Don't forget your quiz for the lesson.

72
00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:20.322
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
