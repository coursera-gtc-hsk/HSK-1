1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,467
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:10,322
[Tónɡxuémen hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:14,515
We learned family members such as

4
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:20,039
[bàbɑ, māmɑ, mèimei] last time.

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,940
Today, you will learn how to
talk about pets in Chinese and

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,554
[yǒu] sentence will be also introduced.

7
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:35,849
I guess the most popular pets
in the world are dogs and cats.

8
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:42,317
Dog is [ɡǒu],
cat is [māo] in Chinese.

9
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:46,613
Read with me please

10
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:51,983
[ɡǒu] [ɡǒu]

11
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:57,353
[māo] [māo]

12
00:00:56,353 --> 00:01:04,649
[dà ɡǒu] [dà ɡǒu]
[xiǎo māo] [xiǎo māo]

13
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:10,241
We learnt [dà] in [Nǐ duō dà?].
How old are you?

14
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:14,011
but the basic meaning of [dà] is big.

15
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:18,204
So, [dà ɡǒu] is big dog.

16
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:21,975
[xiǎo] is small or little.

17
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:26,030
[xiǎo māo] is small cat.

18
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,840
How do you say, I have a dog,

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,408
I don't have a cat?

20
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:41,043
You say [Wǒ yǒu ɡǒu. Wǒ méiyǒu māo.]

21
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:45,614
[yǒu] is to have.

22
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:49,462
[méiyǒu] means don't have.

23
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:54,611
[yǒu] can be used in various ways.

24
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:59,750
But 'to have' is the most
basic meaning of this verb.

25
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,577
The structure is,

26
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:10,698
subject + [yǒu]+ object

27
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:21,086
For example, [wǒ méiyǒu gēge.]

28
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:28,634
[wǒ méiyǒu qián.]

29
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:33,472
Okay, it's video time.

30
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:39,145
Let's listen to Xiaobei and
Xudong talking about their pets.

31
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:44,361
Please pay attention to
the questions below.

32
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:49,040
Who has a big dog?

33
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,720
Who has a small cat?

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,900
How old is the dog?

35
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,141
How old is the cat?

36
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:03,756
What is the name of the dog?

37
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:07,475
What is the name of the cat?

39
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:12,673
>> [Xù dōng, nǐ yǒu gǒu ma?]
>> [Yǒu, wǒ yǒu yī zhī dàgǒu.]

40
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:14,545
>> [Nǐ de gǒu duō dà le?]

41
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:17,233
>> [Qī suì le. Nǐ yǒu gǒu ma?]

42
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:20,817
>> [Wǒ méi yǒu gǒu. Wǒ yǒu yī zhī
 sān suì de xiǎo māo.]

43
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:23,303
>> [Wǒ de gǒu jiào wāngwāng.]

44
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,634
>> [Wǒ de xiǎomāo jiào miāomiāo.]

45
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:29,217
Let's see the answers in Chinese.

46
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:43,714
[Xù dōng yǒu yī zhī dàgǒu.]
[Xiǎo bèi yǒu yī zhī xiǎo māo.]

47
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:53,714
[Xù dōng de gǒu qī suì.]
[Xiǎo bèi de māo sān suì.]

48
00:03:53,714 --> 00:04:03,714
[Gǒu de míng zì jiào wāngwāng.]
[Māo de míng zì jiào miāomiāo.]

49
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,599
Let's have a look at the whole text.

50
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,974
Read after me please

51
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:26,131
>> [Xù dōng, nǐ yǒu gǒu ma?]
>> [Yǒu, wǒ yǒu yī zhī dàgǒu.]

52
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:37,281
>> [Nǐ de gǒu duō dà le?]
>> [Qī suì le. Xiǎo bèi, Nǐ yǒu gǒu ma?]

53
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:47,281
>> [Wǒ méi yǒu gǒu. Wǒ yǒu yī zhī
 sān suì de xiǎo māo.]

54
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:58,281
>> [Wǒ de dàgǒu jiào wāngwāng.]
>> [Wǒ de xiǎomāo jiào miāomiāo.]

55
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:06,270
What is [ma] in the question
 [Nǐ yǒu ɡǒu mɑ?]?

56
00:05:06,270 -->  00:05:10,323
It's a yes or no question
marker in Chinese.

57
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:14,952
By placing [ma] at
the end of the statement,

58
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:19,245
you can convert it into a yes or
no question.

59
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:22,734
Simple and easy, isn't it?

60
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:42,902
[tā yǒu gǒu.] [Tā yǒu gǒu ma?]
[tā méi yǒu māo.] [Tā méi yǒu māo ma?]

61
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:50,680
Xudong says, [wǒ yǒu yī zhī dàgǒu.]

62
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:59,715
Xiaobei says, [Wǒ yǒu yī zhī
 sān suì de xiǎo māo.]

63
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:09,987
[zhī]is a measure some animals word
used for like rabbits,tigers, ducks, etc.

64
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:20,302
[Yī zhī tù zi] [Yī zhī lǎo hǔ]
[Yī zhī yā zi]

65
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,098
Let's do an exercise.

66
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:30,213
Listening to two people
talking about their pets.

67
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:35,922
>> [Wǒ yǒu yī zhī māo jiào lìlì,
 jīn nián wǔ suì]

68
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:41,225
>> [Wǒ yǒu yī zhī gǒu jiào dōngdōng,
 jīn nián jiǔ suì]

69
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:45,235
>> [Wǒ yǒu yī zhī māo jiào lìlì,
 jīn nián wǔ suì]

70
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:51,325
>> [Wǒ yǒu yī zhī gǒu jiào dōngdōng,
 jīn nián jiǔ suì]

71
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:53,562
Let's see the answers.

72
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:03,915
The man has a cat.

73
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:11,259
The dog's name is Dōngdong.

74
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,978
Who is 5 years old?

75
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,050
Lìli.

76
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:26,154
If you have a pet, you may want to
give him or her a Chinese name now.

77
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:30,428
Time to say bye-bye.

78
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:33,234
Hope you enjoyed the lesson.

79
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:36,991
[Xièxie! Zàijiàn!]
