00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:10,322
[Tónɡxuémen hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:10,322 --> 00:00:14,515
We learned family members such as 

4
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:20,039
[bàbɑ, māmɑ, mèimei] last time.

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,940
Today, you will learn how to
talk about pets in Chinese and

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,554
[yǒu] sentence will be also introduced.

7
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:35,849
I guess the most popular pets
in the world are dogs and cats.

8
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:42,317
Dog is [ɡǒu],
cat is [māo] in Chinese.

9
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:46,613
Read with

10
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:51,983
me please, [FOREIGN]

11
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:57,353
[FOREIGN] 

12
00:00:57,353 --> 00:01:01,649
[FOREIGN] 

13
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:10,241
We learnt [dà] in [Nǐ duō dà?], How old are you?

14
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:14,011
but the basic meaning of [dà] is big.

15
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:18,204
So, [dà ɡǒu] is big dog.

16
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:21,975
[xiǎo] is small or little.

17
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:26,030
[xiǎo māo] is small cat.

18
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,840
How do you say, I have a dog,

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,408
I don't have a cat?

20
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:40,043
You say [Wǒ yǒu ɡǒu. Wǒ méiyǒu māo.]

21
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:46,614
[yǒu] means to have.

22
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:49,462
[méiyǒu] means don't have.

23
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:54,611
[yǒu] can be used in various ways.

24
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:59,750
But 'to have' is the most
basic meaning of this verb.

25
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:06,577
The structure is,

26
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:11,698
subject + [yǒu]

27
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:15,965
+ object,

28
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:21,086
for example,

29
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:26,634
[FOREIGN]
okay,

30
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:33,472
it's video time.

31
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:39,145
Let's listen to Xiaobei and
Xudong talking about their pets.

32
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:44,361
Please pay attention to
the questions below.

33
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,040
Who has a big dog?

34
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,720
Who has a small cat?

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,900
How old is the dog?

36
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,141
How old is the cat?

37
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:03,756
What is the name of the dog?

38
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:07,475

52

What is [ma] in

53
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:06,270
the question [Nǐ yǒu ɡǒu mɑ?]?

54
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,890
It's a yes or no question

55
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,323
marker in Chinese.

56
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:14,952
By placing [ma] at
the end of the statement,

57
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:19,245
you can convert it into a yes or
no question.

58
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:22,734
Simple and easy, isn't it?

63
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:58,715

The dog's name is Dōngdong.

76
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,978
Who is 5 years old?

77
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,050
Lìli.

78
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:26,154
If you have a pet, you may want to
give him or her a Chinese name now.

79
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:30,428
Time to say bye-bye.
