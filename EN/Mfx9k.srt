1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,536
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:11,995
[Nǐ hǎo！Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.]

3
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:15,728
[Nǐ xǐhuɑn zuò shénme ɡōnɡzuò?]

4
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:21,187
[Nǐ de bàbɑ, māmɑ, ɡēɡe, jiějie, dìdi, mèimei]

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:28,194
[ài kàn diànyǐnɡ mɑ?
Nǐ de hǎo pénɡyou xǐhuɑn tīnɡ yīnyuè mɑ?]

6
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:32,017
We learned work and hobbies last week.

7
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:36,337
In this week,
we will talk about shopping and food.

8
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:43,863
The first lesson is [Qù shānɡdiàn].

9
00:00:43,863 --> 00:00:46,778
Read the new words with me please.

10
00:00:46,778 --> 00:00:54,652
[shāngdiàn] [mǎi]

11
00:00:54,652 --> 00:01:02,401
[dōngxi] [yīxiē]

12
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:07,025
[shuǐguǒ] [jiàn]

13
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:16,026
[FOREIGN] let's watch a video.

14
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:20,195
Listen to Xiaobei and
Tingna talking about shopping.

15
00:01:20,195 --> 00:01:25,128
Tell me where they're going and
what they are going to do.

16
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,172
>> [FOREIGN]

17
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:37,151
>> [FOREIGN]

18
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,306
>> [FOREIGN]

19
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:42,641
>> [FOREIGN]

20
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:48,181
>> [FOREIGN]

21
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:49,779
>> [FOREIGN]
>> [FOREIGN]

22
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:51,761
>> [FOREIGN]

23
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,687
>> Okay, questions?

24
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:01,579
[Xiǎobèi qù nǎr？]

25
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:07,649
[Tā qù shānɡdiàn. ]

26
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,951
[Tínɡnà qù nǎr？]

27
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:20,910
[Tā qù jiàn yí ɡe tónɡxué.] Okay, read the text with me.

28
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:27,189
[FOREIGN]

29
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:32,571
[FOREIGN]

30
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:42,438
[FOREIGN]

31
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:50,511
[FOREIGN]

32
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:58,585
[Nǐ qù nǎr？] is sort of greetings in Chinese culture.

33
00:02:58,585 --> 00:03:02,191
You may not really want
to know where he or

34
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:06,020
she is going but
just to show your concern.

35
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,013
Usually, when you see somebody doing something like studying,

36
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:17,152
shopping, eating, you may ask, [Xuéxí ne？Mǎi dōnɡxi ne？]

37
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:21,520
[Chīfàn ne？].

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,363
Actually, this kind of conversation
is mainly for greetings,

39
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,970
not for exchanging information.

40
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:37,672
In Chinese culture, restating a fact effect in
a question way, is a way of greeting.

41
00:03:37,672 --> 00:03:43,672
[Xiǎobèi shuō,] [Wǒ qù shānɡdiàn mǎi dōnɡxi.]

42
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:48,115
This sentence contains two verbs [qù] and [mǎi],

43
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:53,224
like I introduced to you before.

44
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:59,011
It is a sentence with serial verbs.

45
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:03,795
[xiǎnɡ] is a very useful word.

46
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:08,636
It can be used to express would like to.

47
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:13,797
In this case, it's an auxiliary verb

48
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:18,323
in the conversation, [Tínɡnà shuō]

49
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:22,153
[Nǐ xiǎnɡ mǎi shénme dōnɡxi？]

50
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:28,281
[Xiǎobèi shuō, wǒ xiǎnɡ mǎi yìxiē shuǐɡuǒ.]

51
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:35,175
And the structure is,

52
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:42,841
subject plus [xiǎnɡ] plus verb plus object.

53
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:49,478
We had [xiǎnɡ] in
previous lesson as well.

54
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:52,525
For example, [FOREIGN].

55
00:04:52,525 --> 00:05:01,666
[FOREIGN].

56
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:10,810
[FOREIGN].

57
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,687
How do you say I'd like
to have a Chinese dish?

58
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:22,215
[FOREIGN]

59
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:25,708
How about,

60
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,415
I don't want to see that person.

61
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:38,529
[FOREIGN].

62
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:42,289
Let's do an exercise,

63
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:47,177
match the phrases with the pictures.

64
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:48,984
Let's have a look.

65
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:55,333
Okay.

66
00:05:55,333 --> 00:06:05,333
[FOREIGN].

67
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:32,989
That's all for today.

68
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:34,868
I hope you enjoyed the lesson.

69
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:38,396
[Xièxie！Zàijiàn！]
