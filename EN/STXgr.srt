00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,437
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:16,437
[Tónɡxuémen hǎo! Huānyínɡ láidào HSK hànyǔ kètánɡ.
 Nǐ xiǎnɡ lái Běijīnɡ mɑ？Nǐ zěnme lái Běijīnɡ?]

3
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:25,437
[Nǐ yào zuò fēijī lái mɑ? Wǒ de pénɡyou lái le，
tā shì jīntiān shànɡwǔ jiǔdiǎn lái de,]

00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:33,681
[tā shì dǎchē lái de. Hé pénɡyou zài yìqǐ,
wǒ hěn ɡāoxìnɡ!]

5
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:37,633
In this lesson,
we're going to learn directions.

6
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:47,247
The title of the lesson is
[wǒ de xiǎo māo ne?]

7
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:51,140
Before watching a video,
let's go over the new words.

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:59,236

9
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:20,236
[shūbāo] [shàngmiàn] [xiàmiàn] [hòumiàn]

10
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:28,254
[shū] is book, [bāo] is bag.

11
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,983
So [shūbāo] is school bag.

12
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:37,931
[shànɡmiàn] and [xiàmiàn] are opposite words.

13
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,941

00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:48,466
[Zài zhuōzi shànɡmiàn.]
Under the chair [zěnme shuō]?

15
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:53,696
[Zài yǐzi xiàmiàn.]

16
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:58,809
[hòumiàn], What is the opposite

17
00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:03,326
word of [hòumiàn]? It's [qiánmiàn].

18
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:07,256
Do you remember how to say outside?

19
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:10,550
Yes, it's [wàimiàn].

20
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,923
And inside?

21
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:17,140
It's [lǐmiàn].

22
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,310
An exercise for you.

23
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,613

26
00:02:51,698 --> 00:03:04,449
